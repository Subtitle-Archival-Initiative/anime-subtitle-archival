1
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:16,009
Master Kiritsugu!

2
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,902
Your child has been born.

3
00:00:25,363 --> 00:00:28,517
She's so cute, she's adorable,

4
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:32,035
and so small, so very delicate.

5
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:34,801
Look, Kiritsugu.

6
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,463
She has your eyes too.

7
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:42,832
She's beautiful.

8
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:45,951
I'm so happy that I could give birth to her.

9
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:55,368
Iri, I...

10
00:00:57,712 --> 00:00:59,863
I will be the cause of your death.

11
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:07,713
I know.

12
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,928
The Einzberns have dreamed of the day.

13
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:13,581
It is the very reason I exist.

14
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:16,122
When I came to know your ideals,

15
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:17,969
I made your wish my own.

16
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:21,011
You made me who I am today.

17
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:23,545
You have guided me on my path.

18
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:28,222
You offered me a better life than that of a simple puppet.

19
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:34,476
You needn't pity me, because I am part of you already.

20
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:36,336
So.

21
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:36,822
But...

22
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:43,853
I have no right to hold that child.

23
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:46,381
None.

24
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:52,699
Kiritsugu, don't forget.

25
00:01:54,298 --> 00:01:56,710
You're striving to make a whole new world

26
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,507
where no one cries.

27
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:02,075
This is what your whole life has been about.

28
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:07,776
Eight more years, and your fight will come to an end,

29
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,863
and our ideal will become reality.

30
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:14,520
The Holy Grail will save you.

31
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:16,248
I'm certain of it.

32
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:22,951
So take this child, Ilyasviel, and hold her close.

33
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:28,251
Hold her and be proud, like any other father would be.

34
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,656
A Command Seal?

35
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:06,550
Yes.

36
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:10,181
The mark identifies you as a
participant in the Holy Grail War.

37
00:03:10,632 --> 00:03:14,851
A stigmata bestowing upon you
the power to command a servant.

38
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,004
Kirei Kotomine.

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,429
The Holy Grail War,

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,031
the battle for an ancient relic that performs miracles.

41
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,868
But why me?

42
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:34,344
Normally, those chosen by the Grail as masters for
the servants are experienced and accomplished mages.

43
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:36,927
It is highly unusual for someone like you,

44
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:41,478
who has no connection to magic
whatsoever, to be chosen to participate.

45
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,371
Heroic servants.

46
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:49,102
I still find it strange to command the summoned
spirits of ancient heroes to fight as familiars.

47
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:53,220
Of course, I know all this can
be very difficult to believe,

48
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:57,421
but heroes from every age and nation
will come back to life in the modern world,

49
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,755
killing one another to vie for supremacy.

50
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:03,698
That is the Holy Grail War.

51
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:07,183
Also, there is an unspoken agreement among all involved

52
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:08,797
to keep this all secret.

53
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,655
To ensure this rule is kept,

54
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,443
someone of the Holy Church is always sent as an observer.

55
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:17,226
Should one of us really be judging?

56
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:20,632
A secret battle between godless magicians?

57
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:22,783
A Mage's Association member

58
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:26,462
would be too partial to one party to assure fairness.

59
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:29,264
And so once again,

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,714
just as we did some 60 years ago,

61
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:35,373
we've recruited your father to
watch over and referee our battle.

62
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,595
My father will be coming to Fuyuki?

63
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:41,977
But wait, how can this be considered fair?

64
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:46,157
It's a conflict of interest for the
overseer's child to also be a participant.

65
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:47,323
Tokiomi?

66
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:50,707
Perhaps it's time we got to the point.

67
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:58,288
Kirei, everything we've spoken of thus far is
just the official background of the Holy Grail War.

68
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:04,691
However, there is an additional reason I've
introduced you to Mr. Tokiomi Tohsaka here today.

69
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,840
And what would that be?

70
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:12,045
Actually, we found proof a long time ago
that the Holy Grail that will appear in Fuyuki

71
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:15,288
is not the sacred relic that belonged to the Son of God.

72
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:17,177
So I gathered.

73
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:22,829
Otherwise, an order to retrieve it would've
been given to us of the Eighth Sacrament Assembly.

74
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:27,775
Be that as it may, Fuyuki's Holy
Grail is far too powerful to ignore.

75
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:30,594
It is an omnipotent wish‐granting device.

76
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:35,270
Who knows what disaster it could unleash
should it happen to fall into the wrong hands.

77
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:36,903
In which case,

78
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:42,540
the best course of action would be to ensure
that the Fuyuki Grail falls into the right hands,

79
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:44,625
hands that would not misuse it.

80
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:47,757
The Tohsakas are a family of mages,

81
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:51,433
but they are mages with a long
history of friendship with the Church.

82
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,189
We know what kind of person Tokiomi
is, and more important than anything else,

83
00:05:56,214 --> 00:06:00,331
the Tohsakas' ultimate intentions
for the Grail are plain and honorable.

84
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,552
To reach the root.

85
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,205
That is the Tohsaka family's sole desire.

86
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:11,092
But the Einzberns and Matous have both
forgotten the wish we once shared with them,

87
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:14,078
and have other less altruistic plans now.

88
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,242
It goes without saying that the plans
of the other masters will be even worse.

89
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:24,730
Who knows what dark desire they may harbor
for the power of the Grail should they obtain it.

90
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:31,418
That being said, I assume that the goal of my
participation is to ensure Tokiomi Tohsaka's victory,

91
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,565
rather than to prevail myself.

92
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,284
To achieve that goal

93
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:40,120
we will conduct ourselves in a manner that
will maintain the appearance of us being enemies.

94
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:43,489
However, we will actually be working together

95
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:47,730
in total secrecy to soundly defeat the other five masters,

96
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:50,472
and assure our victory in the end.

97
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,983
And so, Kirei,

98
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:57,651
you will be officially transferred
from the Church to the Mage's Association

99
00:06:58,102 --> 00:06:59,952
where you will become my student.

100
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,251
The official orders have already been issued.

101
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:06,913
You must go to Japan and study the principles of magic,

102
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:10,298
and become a mage of sufficient strength and skill

103
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:15,727
to command a servant in the Holy Grail War
in three years time when the battles begin.

104
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,841
Now then.

105
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,482
Do you have any questions for us, Kirei?

106
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:25,057
Only one.

107
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:30,573
How exactly does the Holy Grail
go about selecting its masters?

108
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:32,941
What kind of criteria does it use?

109
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,758
Hm.

110
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,551
The exact criteria it uses is unknown, but
it chooses those masters who need it most.

111
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:45,453
So all the participating masters
have a reason to covet the Grail?

112
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,992
Not necessarily.

113
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:50,994
I'm told that in the past there
were cases where Command Seals

114
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:53,954
appeared on those whom you would never have expected.

115
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,342
Oh, I think I understand.

116
00:07:57,816 --> 00:08:01,629
You're still puzzled at being chosen
to be a master by the Grail, aren't you?

117
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:07,949
I didn't expect Kirei to give his consent so quickly.

118
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:12,819
My son would jump into fire if
the Holy Church ordered him to do so.

119
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,070
To be honest with you, I'm even a little shocked.

120
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:17,946
From his perspective,

121
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,333
he's being drawn into a senseless war
that has absolutely nothing to do with him.

122
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:25,169
No, this is as it should be.

123
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:27,883
Perhaps this ordeal will do him some good.

124
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:32,402
Only a few days ago, my son lost his wife.

125
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:37,797
I believe that a complete change of
scenery and a difficult new mission to focus on

126
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:40,886
may be exactly what he needs to nurse his wounds.

127
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:53,282
Hi, Aoi.

128
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,838
Kariya, it's good to see you again.

129
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,079
You're back from your trip?

130
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:04,999
This one seemed to last a long time.

131
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,453
Yeah, I guess it did.

132
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,641
Uncle Kariya!

133
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,772
Uncle Kariya, welcome back!

134
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,546
Hi, Rin.

135
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,203
Did you bring me a present again?

136
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,507
No, Rin, you're being very rude.

137
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,356
Here.

138
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,140
Thank you, Uncle Kariya.

139
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:33,206
You are very welcome, Rin, I'm glad you like it.

140
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,193
Where's Sakura?

141
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,391
Sakura's gone now.

142
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,283
What did she mean?

143
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,265
Sakura is...

144
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:55,981
well, she's no longer my daughter or Rin's little sister.

145
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,671
She's now with... the Matou family.

146
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,097
But why?

147
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,282
The Matous want a child who
carries in them the blood of a mage.

148
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:13,027
You know why, better than anyone else.

149
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:22,561
The head of the Tohsaka family decided to give our
ancient allies, the Matous, that which they requested.

150
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:25,197
It wasn't my place to speak out.

151
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,183
You're all right with that?

152
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:31,261
When I married into the Tohsaka family,

153
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,587
when I decided to marry a mage,

154
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:36,181
I knew what might be required of me.

155
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,649
And you're all right with that?

156
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:45,680
The reality is that a clan bearing mage blood can
never expect to enjoy the happiness of a normal family.

157
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:47,011
That's not true!

158
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:49,526
When you married him you wanted happiness, you wanted...

159
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:50,788
Enough!

160
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,890
This is between the Tohsakas and the Matous.

161
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,769
You left the world of mages a long time ago.

162
00:10:57,328 --> 00:10:58,715
This doesn't concern you.

163
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:06,055
If you get the chance to see Sakura again,

164
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:07,723
please be kind to her.

165
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,224
She was always very fond of you.

166
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:20,286
So, the failure actually had
the nerve to show his face here.

167
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:27,390
I distinctly remember telling you to stay far away
from this house, and to never darken my doorstep again,

168
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:28,783
Kariya.

169
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,945
I heard you adopted the Tohsaka's second daughter.

170
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:34,720
Then you have sharp ears.

171
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:40,203
Is it really so important to keep mages in
the Matou lineage that you have to do this?

172
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,109
Would you tell me we're wrong to?

173
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:43,787
You of all people?

174
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:48,681
Tell me who's fault do you think it is
for our present reduced circumstances.

175
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,019
Kariya,

176
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:53,198
had you only agreed to carry on the family name

177
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:55,383
and to learn the secrets of the Matou,

178
00:11:55,492 --> 00:12:00,331
things would never have gotten this bad,
and that little girl would still be with her mother.

179
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:02,886
You're not fooling anyone, you vampire.

180
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:06,547
You only want the Grail to give yourself eternal youth.

181
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:08,344
You just wanna live forever.

182
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:15,089
Nearly 60 years have passed since
the last time the masters gathered,

183
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:19,468
but the Matous have no pawns yet to
offer for the fourth Holy Grail War.

184
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:25,427
Though you have it inside you, your brother
Byakuya lacks the power needed to control a servant.

185
00:12:25,784 --> 00:12:32,362
But even if we forfeit this round, we could still
win the next in 60 years if we prepare ourselves.

186
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:37,910
The Tohsaka girl's womb will one day bear
us a powerful mage, one who could prevail.

187
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,795
She has a lot of potential,
that one, she could be the key.

188
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:45,983
So then in other words, if you
can get your hands on the Grail,

189
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,696
you won't need Sakura Tohsaka anymore.

190
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:52,837
What is it you're scheming, Kariya?

191
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:55,120
A trade, Zouken.

192
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,626
Next year I will return from the Grail War, Grail in hand,

193
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:03,511
and in return, you will release Sakura.

194
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,913
Don't be a stupid idiot.

195
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:10,083
You're a failure and you haven't
trained a day in your life.

196
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:15,430
You actually believe that in a single year
you'll achieve the power to control a servant?

197
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:22,053
You have the secret magic to make that happen
and you know it, using your special worm techniques.

198
00:13:24,683 --> 00:13:25,543
So?

199
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,934
You can implant me with your crest worms.

200
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:32,035
Kariya, you want to die?

201
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:35,523
The Matous should rely on
themselves to gain what they want.

202
00:13:35,824 --> 00:13:37,739
I won't let anyone else get involved.

203
00:13:39,206 --> 00:13:43,208
Surely you're not concerned for my well-being, Father.

204
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:49,088
If what you're trying to do is keep her out of all this,

205
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:53,982
Kariya, I'm afraid you're a little late.

206
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,732
You bastard, you didn't!

207
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:05,501
For the first three days in there she did
nothing but constantly scream her head off.

208
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:09,616
But on the fourth, she settled down and finally stopped.

209
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:15,471
Early this morning, I threw her down into
the worm pit to see just how long she'd last.

210
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:20,698
She's been in there for over 12
hours and she's still breathing.

211
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:24,647
The Tohsakas have very powerful inner spirits.

212
00:14:25,373 --> 00:14:26,247
Sakura!

213
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:27,834
What will you do now?

214
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:34,308
She's a broken little girl ripped from the life
she knew, and violated by worms from head to toe.

215
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:37,585
But if you still wish to save her from this ordeal,

216
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:40,340
I might be willing to think about it.

217
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,706
I agree.

218
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:47,603
But I intend to continue her
education until you show results.

219
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:49,882
That point is not negotiable.

220
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:54,517
I still expect to achieve victory
in the next war 60 years from now,

221
00:14:54,629 --> 00:15:00,193
but should you somehow manage to retrieve
the Grail in this war, all the better.

222
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,913
Naturally, I'll no longer need the girl. In
that case, her education will only last a year,

223
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:09,336
and then she'll be free to go where she wants.

224
00:15:09,765 --> 00:15:12,605
You won't renege on your words, Zouken Matou?

225
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:16,034
You can start by serving as
the breeding ground for a week.

226
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,673
If you don't die or go insane then I'll concede that

227
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:23,073
you're actually serious and will keep my word completely.

228
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:33,193
It's finally here.

229
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:36,988
What does it say?

230
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,660
It's a report from the spies I
sent to the London Clock Tower.

231
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:45,041
It says that the Grail chose
a master from within the tower,

232
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,985
the headquarters of the Mage's Association.

233
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,219
Who is it?

234
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:50,694
A rather big problem.

235
00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:53,523
The eldest son of the Archibald family,

236
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,202
a ninth generation mage.

237
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:58,482
Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald.

238
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:06,242
In the world of mages, a long and
distinguished lineage is everything.

239
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,105
Nothing else matters.

240
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:13,170
This is because magic will not yield
up her secrets in a single generation.

241
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,733
A parent passes on the fruits of a
lifetime of magical training to his child.

242
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:23,088
Thus, the older the family of mages,
the greater their power ultimately becomes.

243
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:27,703
You are no doubt wondering why I begin
today's lecture with something so basic.

244
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,437
It is because a student from this class
submitted a fascinating paper to me yesterday.

245
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:37,245
"How Wizardry Should Be in the New Century."

246
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:42,841
It attempts to make a case objecting to the
longstanding traditions of which I just spoke.

247
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:47,109
It claims that if one were to achieve
a deep understanding of the techniques

248
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:49,668
and precise control over mana application,

249
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,446
it would allow one to overcome
any difference in inherent ability.

250
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:59,707
In short, even someone with diluted blood could,
through his own efforts, become a master mage.

251
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,352
To be honest, I've learned
something from reading this paper.

252
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:05,609
Silence, please.

253
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,523
I will be perfectly frank.

254
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,703
This paper is nothing but immature juvenile fantasies.

255
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:14,615
Huh?

256
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,584
Blood determines a mage's powers and abilities.

257
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,927
This is a hard and unchanging reality of this world.

258
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:24,463
Even for you, Waver Velvet.

259
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:30,416
I am very, very disappointed that one of my
students would indulge in this moronic nonsense.

260
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:35,331
Sir, I was only trying to raise a question the
Mage's Association has become too reluctant to address.

261
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:38,679
Mr. Velvet, if I recall correctly,

262
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:42,194
your family has produced mages for only three generations.

263
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,596
Isn't that right?

264
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:48,768
Listen to me, compared to the Mage's
Association's long and illustrious history,

265
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:51,703
your family is no more than a newborn baby.

266
00:17:51,876 --> 00:17:56,218
Don't you think a baby should learn to
speak before it tries to voice an opinion?

267
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,189
He made a fool of me,

268
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:00,068
he made a fool of me,

269
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:01,457
he made a fool of me!

270
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:03,341
Is that any way for a teacher to act?

271
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:06,274
Reading my paper made him
jealous and he couldn't handle it!

272
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,480
The pompous ass is afraid of my talent.

273
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,844
That's why he embarrassed me in front of everyone.

274
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:11,903
Whoa!

275
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

276
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:16,507
Are you all right?

277
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:17,977
I'm fine.

278
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,628
You're in the Spiritual Evocation Department.

279
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:23,345
Why aren't you in class?

280
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,403
Well, uh,

281
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:27,668
Mr. Archibald asked me to run an errand for him.

282
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:29,808
That's why I was in a hurry.

283
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:32,737
I see, that's great.

284
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:35,462
Would you mind giving this to
him when you go back to class?

285
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:39,832
Okay, sure, why not?

286
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:43,635
Just make sure he gets it, it's supposed to be important.

287
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:44,938
It's important?

288
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,378
Package origin, Macedonia?

289
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:57,753
This is it.

290
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:00,736
So it seems that all the rumors about that

291
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:06,335
bastard Kayneth Archibald preparing to fight in some
kind of mages tournament in the Far East soon are true.

292
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,142
The Holy Grail War.

293
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:19,372
According to the legend, 200 years ago,
the Einzberns, the Makiris, and the Tohsakas,

294
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,963
collectively known as the three first families,

295
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:24,463
worked together to summon the Holy Grail,

296
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:28,403
said to have the power to grant
any wish, and eventually succeeded it.

297
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:34,673
But the Holy Grail would only grant
one of the family's supplications.

298
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:40,265
Their cooperation quickly turned
to violent and bloody conflict.

299
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:43,460
That was the beginning of the Holy Grail Wars.

300
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:46,840
Ever since then, once every 60 years,

301
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:49,402
the Holy Grail appears in the city of Fuyuki.

302
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:54,614
It selects seven mages from across the
globe to compete for it, and grants them powers.

303
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,428
Each magically summons a heroic spirit known as a servant.

304
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:06,164
Archer, Saber, Lancer, Rider, Assassin,

305
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:08,708
Caster, Berserker.

306
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:14,856
Divided into these seven classes of
warriors, the servants, guided by their masters,

307
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:20,471
fight each other to the death in secret battles
to determine who is worthy to win the Grail.

308
00:20:24,053 --> 00:20:26,436
So it appears that this Grail War

309
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:31,812
is a battle of pure strength where stupid
titles and influence mean absolutely nothing.

310
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:35,144
That looks like it's the perfect place for me.

311
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:43,486
Wait, in order to summon a servant some kind of
relic related to them is needed to act as a catalyst.

312
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,936
A relic.

313
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:19,518
That device always strikes me as being indecent.

314
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:22,078
There's a report from the Clock Tower.

315
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:25,769
It looks like Lord El‐Melloi has acquired another relic.

316
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,646
His participation in the war is certain now.

317
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:33,850
It troubles me that two of the
slots are still unaccounted for.

318
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,729
Don't worry, when the time comes, the
Grail will select seven, regardless of skill.

319
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:41,189
The ones it selects to round out the group are...

320
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,899
well, often weak and inexperienced.

321
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:45,453
Don't concern yourself.

322
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,533
Speaking of matters of real concern, Kirei,

323
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:52,014
I trust that no one followed
you or saw you enter this mansion.

324
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,279
No, don't worry.

325
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:59,221
No familiars or devices, visible or invisible,
are watching me or this mansion right now.

326
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:00,888
On that.

327
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:03,298
You have my guarantee.

328
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:09,502
No matter what tricks or deception they
use, no one can deceive the eyes of Hassan,

329
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,762
the spy heroic spirit.

330
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:16,866
There is no trace of anyone following
my master or watching this house.

331
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,113
Please, you can put your mind at ease.

332
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,857
If a servant has been manifested by another master

333
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:26,327
my father is certain to be aware of it.

334
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:28,966
The other mages will not take action,

335
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,199
at least for a little while longer.

336
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:35,933
Assassin, you may go, continue
guarding the surrounding area.

337
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,119
As you wish.

338
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:42,471
It's only a matter of time before that changes.

339
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:49,538
Very soon now this place will be swarming with familiars
and magical devices sent by other masters to spy on me.

340
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:51,339
What is that?

341
00:22:51,391 --> 00:22:53,158
Another investigation.

342
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:57,871
I've been gathering what information
I can on the Einzbern master.

343
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:03,949
Nine years ago, the Einzberns, a family
notoriously proud of their pure blood,

344
00:23:04,156 --> 00:23:07,790
suddenly allowed an outsider
mage to marry into the family.

345
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:14,499
The Einzbern mages have devoted
themselves solely to alchemy,

346
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,939
rendering them unfit for combat.

347
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:21,286
Their losses in previous Grail
Wars can all be traced to that fact.

348
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:24,365
They must have finally run out of patience.

349
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:29,351
The man they chose was perfect for their needs.

350
00:23:32,436 --> 00:23:37,757
Kiritsugu Emiya, the man known as the Mage Killer.

351
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:49,729
We finally found the relic we've been
searching for in Cornwall all these years.

352
00:23:49,848 --> 00:23:53,641
If you use it as a catalyst you'll be
able to summon what is widely considered

353
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:57,244
the strongest of all known sword‐wielding servants.

354
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,007
Kiritsugu,

355
00:23:59,247 --> 00:24:04,919
this is the greatest gift the Einzbern can offer
to the man who is working in service to our needs.

356
00:24:04,956 --> 00:24:07,123
Thank you, Elder, I am honored.

357
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:10,882
This time there are to be no survivors.

358
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,502
You are to hunt down the six
other servants and eliminate them,

359
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:17,652
and fulfill the third magic, Heaven's Feel.

360
00:24:18,317 --> 00:24:19,137
Yes, sir.

361
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:22,653
Kiritsugu Emiya?

362
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:25,445
Yes, I know that name.

363
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:29,644
So, even the Holy Church has heard of this man.

364
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:35,064
Kiritsugu Emiya, the Mage Killer,
was quite infamous in his time.

365
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:39,465
Officially, he was a rogue mage
who didn't belong to the Association,

366
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:44,510
but the higher ups found him, shall we
say, convenient for their own purposes.

367
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,264
It sounds to me like he was quite similar to us.

368
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:49,404
Executioners for the Holy Church.

369
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:51,364
Far worse, I assure you.

370
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:54,836
He spent his life as a freelance master assassin

371
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:57,604
who specializes in exterminating mages.

372
00:24:57,939 --> 00:25:03,918
He knows what mages are capable of, so he deals
with them in a way that is unlike a mage as possible.

373
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:06,612
Read that.

374
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:12,849
Sniping, poisoning, bombs in public places.

375
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:17,387
He once brought down an entire jetliner
just because his target was on it.

376
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:21,829
A man who will do anything without a second thought.

377
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:27,505
It is because mages function
outside the laws of the regular world

378
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:32,175
that we must diligently obey the strict
laws that we have set for ourselves.

379
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:37,194
But this man lacks even a single
trace of a mage's pride or honor.

380
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:40,897
The methods he employs are unforgivable.

381
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:46,631
Then tell me, what does this Kiritsugu Emiya gain...

382
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:50,616
by hiring himself out as a killer?

383
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:52,562
Money, I would imagine.

384
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:55,484
As you can read in that report,

385
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:59,545
he's been involved in more than just mage assassinations.

386
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:06,236
He's appeared in war zones all over the
planet offering his services as a mercenary.

387
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,504
I see.

388
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,003
May I borrow this for a while?

389
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:20,411
Let's go over what we know, Iri, all right?

390
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,312
Of the seven masters that the Grail will
choose we have identified four of them.

391
00:26:27,229 --> 00:26:30,418
Tokiomi Tohsaka, Tohsaka family head.

392
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:33,957
Fire mage, uses jewel magic, very formidable.

393
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,351
Kariya Matou.

394
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,612
So they took the kid who left the
family and made him a master, huh?

395
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:43,016
That old man must be desperate.

396
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:46,690
Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald.

397
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:48,932
Wind and water affinity.

398
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:53,593
He's a top expert in necromancy, summoning, and alchemy.

399
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:55,244
And next...

400
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:56,731
Kiritsugu Emiya.

401
00:26:57,131 --> 00:27:02,885
Newest member of the Einzbern family and
their trump card, and the man that I love.

402
00:27:05,494 --> 00:27:09,242
And the fourth master... no, I mean the fifth one,

403
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,496
is representing the Holy Church.

404
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:13,401
His name is Kirei Kotomine.

405
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:15,524
He's from the Church?

406
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:19,500
He's the son of the overseer, Father Risei Kotomine.

407
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,108
Reports say he studied under Tokiomi
Tohsaka starting three years ago,

408
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:26,664
splitting with him after his Command Seal appeared.

409
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:28,796
Did something happen?

410
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:30,797
This is his personal history.

411
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,788
Read it for yourself.

412
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,549
Kirei Kotomine followed his father on
pilgrimages around the world since childhood,

413
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:44,113
graduated from the St. Ignatius
School of Divinity in Manresa,

414
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:47,226
skipped two years, graduated valedictorian.

415
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,243
He sounds pretty impressive.

416
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:54,612
But then suddenly, he leaves the primrose
path and volunteers for the Holy Church.

417
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:59,422
Why would someone like that decide to
work for a secret Church organization?

418
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:01,524
Maybe because of his father?

419
00:28:01,989 --> 00:28:06,777
It says here that Kotomine is a member of
the Holy Church's Eighth Sacrament Assembly.

420
00:28:07,482 --> 00:28:10,056
Then he would've pursued that
path from the very beginning.

421
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:16,647
But until he arrived at the same place as
his father, he changed positions three times.

422
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:19,702
At one time he was even an inquisitor.

423
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,938
An inquisitor?

424
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:24,105
A heretic hunter.

425
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:28,244
In essence, exactly what I was.

426
00:28:28,537 --> 00:28:30,459
A ruthless mage killer.

427
00:28:31,472 --> 00:28:33,079
Kiritsugu Emiya.

428
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:39,090
His assassinations were always carried out in
clusters over a relatively short period of time.

429
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:43,970
During the same general time periods,
he appeared in a number of war zones,

430
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,645
but only when the combat was at its fiercest.

431
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:50,739
It was almost as if he had some
obsession with chasing his own death.

432
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:54,738
These were clearly the actions of a man bent on suicide.

433
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:59,413
So then why is he doing this?

434
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:03,780
Alchemy, necromancy, summoning, divination, healing.

435
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:08,188
Interesting, look at all the
categories of magic he studied.

436
00:29:08,534 --> 00:29:10,343
Why did he try to study so many?

437
00:29:10,691 --> 00:29:13,326
He gets almost to the point of mastery of a discipline,

438
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:17,212
then switches to another field,
and never looks back again.

439
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:22,708
It's... it's as if he throws away
everything he's learned like yesterday's trash.

440
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:29,024
Iri, this man, Kirei Kotomine, terrifies me.

441
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:32,285
He has no concept of self interest.

442
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:37,402
His actions are completely disconnected
from any thought of risk versus reward.

443
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:41,847
No way, there's no way he's just
a freelancer in it for the money.

444
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:45,725
He's never shown any passion
for anything at all in his life.

445
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:48,409
He believes in absolutely nothing.

446
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:53,187
He has no deep desire, no wish of any kind to be granted.

447
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:55,414
A man like that...

448
00:29:55,648 --> 00:29:58,358
Then what is he after?

449
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:02,279
Why would he put his life at risk to get the Holy Grail?

450
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:07,750
But the Grail chose him to be one
of its seven masters for this war.

451
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:12,851
You're right, he must have some reason
we don't know about to want the Grail.

452
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:20,076
But I can't even begin to imagine
what it is, and that terrifies me.

453
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,119
Kirei Kotomine.

454
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,523
Kiritsugu Emiya.

455
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:33,456
His endless string of battles came to a sudden halt
nine years ago, and he virtually vanished from sight.

456
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:37,002
It appears that his final
encounter with the mages of the North,

457
00:30:37,027 --> 00:30:39,983
the Einzberns, is where he at last found his answer.

458
00:30:40,635 --> 00:30:43,411
So, I must ask the question,

459
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:45,902
what did he seek in those battles?

460
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:47,665
What was he looking for?

461
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,706
And what exactly did he find?

462
00:31:01,828 --> 00:31:04,727
Well, you just barely made it.

463
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:11,556
If the Grail has chosen you, that must mean
that you've made at least some progress as a mage.

464
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,412
I'll give you that much, Kariya.

465
00:31:16,227 --> 00:31:17,570
But look at you.

466
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:20,163
You look like bloody hell.

467
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:24,629
Is your left leg working all right, eh?

468
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:39,642
Now don't get angry, you know if you get the crest worms
inside you worked up too much they'll simply devour you.

469
00:31:40,854 --> 00:31:46,755
Either way, I'd give you perhaps a month at best
before they do their damage and drain the life out of you.

470
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:49,204
That's plenty.

471
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,585
What did you say?

472
00:31:50,754 --> 00:31:53,498
I said that that will be plenty of time.

473
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:58,807
Kariya, this is your present for surviving an entire year.

474
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,048
I found the perfect relic for you.

475
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:05,815
Don't let your loving father's kindness go to waste.

476
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:19,965
I did it, I've got a Command Seal too!

477
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,485
The Grail chose me as a master!

478
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:26,351
My incredible talent has been recognized by the Grail!

479
00:32:28,902 --> 00:32:30,235
I can't just sit here.

480
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:33,173
I have to prepare to summon my servant.

481
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:39,728
Mikina Nishimoto, the missing sixth grade girl from...

482
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:41,102
Good morning, Waver.

483
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:44,833
Good morning, dear. How did you sleep?

484
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:48,621
Morning, Grandpa and Grandma.

485
00:32:49,526 --> 00:32:51,321
Fuyuki's getting bad these days.

486
00:32:51,362 --> 00:32:53,402
Yes, it really is.

487
00:32:53,628 --> 00:32:55,685
By the way, Martha, it's very strange.

488
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:59,817
I've heard roosters making a big
racket since the sun came up this morning.

489
00:33:00,317 --> 00:33:01,790
What's that all about?

490
00:33:02,072 --> 00:33:05,325
It's because there are three roosters in our yard.

491
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:06,919
What're they doing there?

492
00:33:07,124 --> 00:33:08,364
I don't know.

493
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:11,055
I've been wondering where they might've come from.

494
00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:13,936
Oh, sweetie, you want some coffee?

495
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:15,575
Mhm.

496
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:16,681
Waver.

497
00:33:16,842 --> 00:33:18,701
What happened to your hand?

498
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:20,179
Crap.

499
00:33:20,477 --> 00:33:21,659
That mark.

500
00:33:21,755 --> 00:33:22,612
What mark?

501
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:25,691
You didn't have that mark on your hand yesterday.

502
00:33:26,058 --> 00:33:27,797
Ah, bugger!

503
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:30,586
I really wish you hadn't noticed that.

504
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,606
What's wrong, Waver?

505
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:34,226
What is it, dear?

506
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:37,310
Nothing's wrong, here, have some coffee.

507
00:33:37,674 --> 00:33:39,547
I put lots of milk in it.

508
00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:43,453
You two like coffee, right?

509
00:33:50,955 --> 00:33:52,510
What a pain in the ass.

510
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:58,665
Do I have to start their hypnosis all over again,
starting from me being their grandson back from abroad?

511
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:06,522
I need to think of a cover story
for those roosters I stole too.

512
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:11,159
I can't believe they really found
the legendary Excalibur's scabbard.

513
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:13,625
There's not a scratch on it.

514
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:17,187
Is this thing really 1,500 years old?

515
00:34:17,804 --> 00:34:20,777
The object itself is a type of conceptual weapon.

516
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,809
It doesn't rust or degrade as
ordinary physical objects do.

517
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:31,651
Just like in the legend surrounding its existence, it
heals its owner's wounds and halts the aging process.

518
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:36,178
Of course, that's only when supplied
with its original owner's mana.

519
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:40,960
In other words, the master can use this
in tandem with the summoned heroic spirit

520
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,726
to protect himself during the course of a battle.

521
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,341
That's just like you.

522
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:48,689
What you're saying is that a tool is just a tool?

523
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:51,813
That's right, I am, and that goes for the servant too.

524
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:56,218
No matter how famous the heroic spirit,
when summoned as a servant they're nothing

525
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:58,400
but a tool for their master.

526
00:34:59,332 --> 00:35:01,967
Anyone who lets their fantasies get the better of them

527
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:04,862
will never have the wherewithal to win this battle.

528
00:35:05,223 --> 00:35:08,458
And because you're the way you
are, my great‐grandfather decided

529
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:11,182
this scabbard was the perfect relic for you.

530
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:12,872
What do you think?

531
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:16,489
Does his gift not satisfy you?

532
00:35:16,954 --> 00:35:18,244
Of course it does.

533
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:20,213
Acht did a wonderful job.

534
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,455
None of the other masters have something this powerful.

535
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:25,658
What's wrong with it then?

536
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:29,442
Given how perfectly the ancient relic is connected to it,

537
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:32,554
the heroic spirit, the one we're after,

538
00:35:32,794 --> 00:35:34,904
will surely respond to the summons,

539
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:38,963
the King of Knights, Arthur Pendragon.

540
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:43,077
My own compatibility with him is a secondary concern.

541
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:46,578
But Arthur, the wielder of Excalibur,

542
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:50,351
is sure to be the strongest Saber class
servant the Grail Wars have ever seen.

543
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:52,085
That's true.

544
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:55,522
I'll have a servant far stronger
than any other in the battle.

545
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:59,657
The question is, how best to use that power?

546
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:01,560
How to make it work for us?

547
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:05,011
To be honest, in terms of ease of use,

548
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:09,642
Caster or Assassin would be far
better suited to the way I usually fight.

549
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:13,908
What good will it do to worry about
that before you've even summoned him?

550
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,420
After all, we don't know what
the King of Knights was like,

551
00:36:18,224 --> 00:36:21,410
and besides, no matter what your strategy is,

552
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:25,014
once he learns of your ideals, of your dream,

553
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:28,357
he'll understand, I know he will.

554
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:31,899
Just like I did.

555
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,284
What is it?

556
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:42,610
I've found my strategy, the way to get the best use.

557
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:47,111
From the strongest servant fighting in the battle.

558
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:56,748
Hello, Rin.

559
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:00,590
Oh hello, Kirei.

560
00:37:00,943 --> 00:37:01,923
Heading out?

561
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:04,143
That's some heavy luggage you have there.

562
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:08,744
That's right, I have to go live
with the Zenjou family for a while.

563
00:37:10,752 --> 00:37:15,323
You're staying to fight alongside
my father in a coming war, aren't you?

564
00:37:15,535 --> 00:37:19,304
That's why I'm here as his student,
to help him and to learn from him.

565
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:24,102
Kirei, can I depend on you?

566
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:24,855
Huh?

567
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:28,149
Will you promise to protect my father to the end?

568
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:30,277
Will you promise to keep him safe?

569
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,417
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.

570
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:36,902
If this battle were going to be simple
enough that I could honestly make that promise,

571
00:37:37,162 --> 00:37:41,201
we wouldn't have to send you or your mother
away from here to keep you safe and sound.

572
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,907
I guess that means I just can't like you no matter what.

573
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:51,655
Rin, you shouldn't just blurt out
what you're really thinking like that.

574
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:54,790
People might start to cast aspersions on your father.

575
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,550
He is the man who's educating you after all.

576
00:37:57,597 --> 00:37:59,569
My father has nothing to do with it!

577
00:37:59,704 --> 00:38:05,063
Listen, Kirei, if you somehow get sloppy and
because of that my father gets hurt or worse,

578
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,298
I'll show you no mercy, got it?

579
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:11,340
Rin, what're you doing out there?
How come you're yelling at him?

580
00:38:12,062 --> 00:38:15,697
Um, I... Well, you see...

581
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:20,607
Oh, she was just giving me a bit of
encouragement before we said goodbye, ma'am.

582
00:38:21,014 --> 00:38:22,550
Rin, allow me.

583
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:25,801
That big suitcase is far too heavy for you to carry alone.

584
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,804
No thank you, I'll carry it myself.

585
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,648
Kirei, do your best to take care of my husband.

586
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:35,543
Please help him to achieve his desire.

587
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:37,671
I will do my best.

588
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:39,071
Please, don't worry.

589
00:38:42,678 --> 00:38:44,334
Excuse me.

590
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:50,969
You've arrived at a very opportune time. The relic
I made arrangements for finally arrived this morning.

591
00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:52,204
Have a look.

592
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,884
What is it?

593
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,187
A fossil of the very first skin
shed by a snake on this world.

594
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:07,549
If we use it as a catalyst and are lucky enough
to summon the heroic spirit that we're after,

595
00:39:07,756 --> 00:39:10,395
total victory is as good as ours.

596
00:39:16,364 --> 00:39:18,293
Hey, Sakura.

597
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:20,530
Did I startle you?

598
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:23,395
Yeah, your face is...

599
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,333
I know.

600
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:28,373
Seems I lost a little bit of it
to the worms that are inside me.

601
00:39:29,353 --> 00:39:33,094
I guess I'm just not quite as tough as you are.

602
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:39,208
Uncle Kariya, you're turning
into a different person, aren't you?

603
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,777
Yeah, maybe.

604
00:39:43,529 --> 00:39:47,399
You know, I don't have to go
to the worm pit again tonight.

605
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,992
Grandfather said there will be a more
important ceremony that I have to attend.

606
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:53,378
Yeah, I know.

607
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:56,916
That's why I'm going to the
basement tonight instead of you.

608
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,902
Uncle Kariya, are you going somewhere far away?

609
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:05,105
Well, I have an important job
that I need to do for a while.

610
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:10,979
I might not have much time to talk
to you then, at least until I get back.

611
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:13,509
I see.

612
00:40:14,149 --> 00:40:15,515
Hey, Sakura.

613
00:40:16,006 --> 00:40:20,181
When my job is finally over, you
wanna go somewhere and just have fun?

614
00:40:20,474 --> 00:40:22,357
With your mom and your sister too.

615
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:28,007
I don't have anyone I can call Mom or Sister.

616
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:31,179
Grandfather said that I should just think of them

617
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:33,450
like they never existed.

618
00:40:35,707 --> 00:40:36,807
I see.

619
00:40:46,874 --> 00:40:47,768
Uncle?

620
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,241
All right then.

621
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:53,657
When this is all over let's
take Aoi and Rin from the Tohsakas

622
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,888
and go somewhere as far away
from this place as we can get.

623
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:01,279
We can hang out and have fun like we used to.

624
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:04,876
Does that mean we'll see them again?

625
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:07,154
Yeah, you will.

626
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:09,660
You have my word on that.

627
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:15,849
All right.

628
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:18,619
I have to get going now.

629
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:19,983
Mhm.

630
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,271
Bye‐bye, Uncle Kariya.

631
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:29,022
Bye‐bye.

632
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,372
I assume you've memorized the summoning spell correctly?

633
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:35,687
Sure.

634
00:41:35,874 --> 00:41:36,920
Very well.

635
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:41,545
But I'm going to have to add two
extra lines to the basic incantation.

636
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:43,356
What do you mean?

637
00:41:43,576 --> 00:41:45,522
It's really quite simple, Kariya.

638
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:47,983
Because of your short time in training,

639
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:53,178
your rank as a mage is somewhat lower than that
of the other masters that the Grail has summoned.

640
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,552
That will affect the servant's base abilities.

641
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:59,911
This means we have to boost the servant's parameters

642
00:41:59,936 --> 00:42:03,719
by attempting to modify the
servant's class as much as possible.

643
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:11,872
Kariya, to that end, I want you to add the
affinity insanity to the servant you summon today.

644
00:42:14,014 --> 00:42:16,553
Fill, fill, fill, fill, fill.

645
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:21,979
Repeat five times, but when each is filled, destroy it.

646
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:28,318
For the elements silver and iron, the
foundation stone and the Archduke of Pacts,

647
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:31,381
and for my great master, Schenewerk,

648
00:42:31,657 --> 00:42:35,015
raise a wall against the wind and
close the gates of four directions.

649
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,768
Come forth from the crown and follow
the forked road leading to the kingdom.

650
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:45,544
Is a simple ritual like this really
enough to summon a heroic spirit?

651
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:47,447
Surprisingly, yes.

652
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:53,540
You see, the summoning ritual doesn't
require a big elaborate evocation.

653
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:57,403
The actual summoning is preformed by the Grail itself.

654
00:42:57,811 --> 00:42:59,473
My job as a master is to firmly anchor

655
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:02,776
the heroic spirit in this world and to supply it

656
00:43:03,056 --> 00:43:06,209
with enough mana to take physical form.

657
00:43:07,307 --> 00:43:08,446
That should do it.

658
00:43:09,752 --> 00:43:12,394
Iri, put the relic on the altar.

659
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:15,125
That is the final step.

660
00:43:16,171 --> 00:43:21,721
Heed my words, my will creates your
body, and your sword creates my destiny.

661
00:43:22,114 --> 00:43:27,892
If you heed the Grail's call and obey my
will and reason, then answer my summoning!

662
00:43:28,603 --> 00:43:32,939
I hereby swear that I shall be all the good in the world,

663
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:37,058
that I shall defeat all evil in the world.

664
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:41,651
Then let thine eyes be clouded
with the fog of turmoil and chaos.

665
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:47,607
Thou who art trapped in a cage of madness,
and I the summoner who holds thy chains!

666
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:51,120
Seventh heaven clad in the great words of power,

667
00:43:51,543 --> 00:43:53,660
come forth from this circle of binding,

668
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:55,610
Guardian of Scales!

669
00:44:27,175 --> 00:44:28,729
Behold him, Kirei.

670
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,828
We have won the battle.

671
00:44:32,143 --> 00:44:33,750
Victory is ours!

672
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:42,505
Impossible.

673
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:44,920
I ask you...

674
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:54,236
Are you worthy to be my master?

675
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:33,303
I think what you and Kiritsugu seek is right and just.

676
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,761
The world cannot serve two lords.

677
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:39,261
Then I promise you, you are not worthy to gaze upon me.

678
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:40,912
