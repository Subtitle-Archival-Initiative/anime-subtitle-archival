1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,500
See, see? I told you so!

2
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:15,525
This car takes the turns really fast!

3
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,821
Well, that's because you're a surprisingly good driver.

4
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:21,953
I know!

5
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:24,940
You may not believe it, but I practice all the time!

6
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:31,088
Of all the toys Kiritsugu has brought me
over the years, this is my absolute favorite!

7
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:33,017
This is a toy?

8
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:42,155
At the castle, I was only allowed to
drive around the courtyard, so this is great!

9
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:46,776
Shouldn't we have maybe hired a professional driver?

10
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:48,448
No, that would be boring.

11
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:50,328
I mean, it could be really dangerous.

12
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:53,529
What if the enemy were to
suddenly launch an attack against us?

13
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:55,408
Well, I suppose you have a point but...

14
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:56,942
Stop the car!

15
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:06,496
Irisviel, get out of the car

16
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,511
and stay very close to me.

17
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:10,255
This presence...

18
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:12,008
it's a Servant!

19
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,674
I have come for you, my sweet and holy virgin!

20
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:04,762
Do you know this man?

21
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:06,648
I've never laid eyes on him.

22
00:03:07,147 --> 00:03:08,394
Oh no!

23
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:11,427
Are you saying that you've forgotten my face?

24
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:12,494
Forgotten you?

25
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:14,108
I've never met you in my life.

26
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:15,858
You mistake me for another.

27
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,405
Agh!

28
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,324
It's me!

29
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:20,691
It's Gilles de Rais, my darling!

30
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:25,695
I have prayed for your resurrection and
have been waiting for a miracle to reunite us!

31
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:30,667
To that end, I've come all this
way, to the end of time, my Jeanne!

32
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:32,351
Who is Jeanne?

33
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,577
I know not your name, I assure you.

34
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:37,927
Nor have I any idea who this Jeanne might be.

35
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:39,241
No...

36
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:42,369
No, you can't have forgotten!

37
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:44,406
Not your former identity!

38
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,959
As you have seen fit to give me your name,

39
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:51,186
then I must, in keeping with
the chivalric code, give mine.

40
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:53,151
My name is Arturia,

41
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:55,552
the heir to Uther Pendragon,

42
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,084
and King of Britain.

43
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:00,665
I enter this battle in the Saber class.

44
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:01,977
Oh no!

45
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:02,976
How tragic!

46
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,709
It's so very sad!

47
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:08,410
She's lost her memory and gone completely insane!

48
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,600
Curse Him.

49
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,737
Curse Him!

50
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:16,556
Such cruel tortures God inflicts upon my
beautiful maiden! Such horrible injustices!

51
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:17,088
Enough!

52
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:18,407
You embarrass yourself!

53
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:20,342
Awaken, O fair one.

54
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:23,523
You have no need to call yourself Saber any longer.

55
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:26,638
Because the Holy Grail War has already ended.

56
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:31,870
The Grail has chosen me, Gilles, to be
its champion, with no fighting at all!

57
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:38,465
For, you see, my one and only eternal wish, the
resurrection of Jeanne d'Arc, has finally been granted!

58
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,398
Ha...

59
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:54,923
If you mock the true prayers of all the
other heroes again, the next strike will be real!

60
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:56,603
Now rise!

61
00:04:57,385 --> 00:05:00,860
Has your heart been sealed so tightly, my dearest Jeanne?

62
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:01,821
Very well.

63
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:02,787
That's too bad.

64
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:05,967
If drastic measures are called for to free your heart,

65
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:08,752
I will take my leave of you to go and prepare.

66
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,746
I swear to you, Jeanne!

67
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:16,483
I will not rest until I can free your soul
from the terrible prison of God's cruel curse.

68
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:27,274
It's very difficult to deal with one
who ignores everything that you're saying.

69
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:30,318
Next time, I shall strike before he speaks!

70
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:33,028
His type completely infuriates me.

71
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:36,247
However, this encounter may
have actually been a fortunate one.

72
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:42,345
I sensed that he was too dangerous to
face without the full use of my left hand.

73
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:53,484
Following Saber's Master has yielded unexpected fruits.

74
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:55,698
We found Caster as well.

75
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,557
Of course, we must follow him.

76
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:01,783
Ah, no, no.

77
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:04,188
The thumb needs to go like this!

78
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:09,592
That's nice!

79
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,319
Perfect in fact!

80
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,480
Welcome back, big guy.

81
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:24,833
Hey!

82
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:26,073
What the hell?

83
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:27,897
Accursed God!

84
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:32,393
He keeps an iron grip on
Jeanne's soul, refusing to let go!

85
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,454
By Jeanne I assume you mean the
girl you saw in the crystal ball?

86
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:40,341
We must prove the cold hear talked to her!

87
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:43,461
That God's power is gone and my love wasted!

88
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:45,733
That no deed no matter how foul,

89
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:49,383
no crime no matter how horrible
is worthy of God's punishment!

90
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:51,269
Yeah, I get it.

91
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:53,429
You're even cooler than I thought!

92
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:57,827
Therefore, we require greater
depravities, greater blasphemies.

93
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:01,621
We must erect a veritable Tower
of Babel of human sacrifices!

94
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:08,438
Mmm, uh, so basically, from
now on it's quantity over quality?

95
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,457
Indeed!

96
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:10,935
Exactly so!

97
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:13,361
Impressive, Ryunosuke.

98
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:17,804
Our first step will be sacrificing
the eleven in their cells right away.

99
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:22,197
And then, we'll go acquire some
more children for our revelries.

100
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:27,280
It's kind of a waste, don't you think?

101
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:29,687
Uh...

102
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,352
We interrupt this regularly scheduled program
to bring you this important breaking news.

103
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,892
An unexplained explosion has occurred

104
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,402
in the Fuyuki Coastal Warehouse District.

105
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:43,822
We go live to the scene.

106
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:49,252
Why did you fail to finish off Saber when you faced her?

107
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,935
Not once but twice.

108
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:55,406
You made me waste the Command Seal, and
yet you couldn't finish the job, idiot!

109
00:07:57,032 --> 00:08:00,696
Was your encounter with Saber
really that much fun for you?

110
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:02,831
It wasn't like that, Master.

111
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:10,894
I swear on my honor as a knight, as a Servant
of the Grail War, I will bring you Saber's head.

112
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:13,416
You don't need to swear to me again!

113
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:14,662
Of course you will!

114
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:18,281
You made a pact with me to defeat
all others for the Holy Grail.

115
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:22,897
And now you sit there like a sniveling
fool swearing to bring me the head of Saber?

116
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,274
What about this do you not understand!?

117
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,042
Aren't you the one who's mistaken here,

118
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:30,188
Lord El‐Melloi?

119
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,428
Sola‐Ui.

120
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:35,616
Lancer actually did well.

121
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,571
I'm afraid you're the one who made the mistake.

122
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:42,012
Saber is a highly skilled and powerful Servant.

123
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:46,615
I simply couldn't allow a chance to
defeat her pass me by without trying.

124
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:49,683
He inflicted a wound on her that cannot heal.

125
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,764
By letting her go, you can defeat her at your leisure.

126
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:59,100
If you're that concerned about her and her lauded
abilities, why didn't you go after her Master instead?

127
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,553
You merely stayed hidden and watched.

128
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:02,876
Rather pathetic.

129
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:06,044
Honestly, Kayneth.

130
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,720
It isn't that you don't understand your
distinct advantage over all the other Masters.

131
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,207
You were the one who ensured that.

132
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:17,251
You made a special alteration
to the usual Master‐Servant pact

133
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:19,878
that no one other than I knows anything about.

134
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:25,600
You control Command Seals, and I act as an
additional Master and supply the Servant mana.

135
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:26,968
Brilliant.

136
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:30,768
You weren't the Evocation Division's
brightest star for nothing, you know?

137
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,026
But we must take care at the beginning.

138
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:36,202
Must we now?

139
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:39,260
So you'll hide while you make Lancer take all the risks?

140
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,053
All right, that's enough of that.

141
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:45,278
Any more will be an insult to my Master.

142
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:48,580
As a knight, I cannot allow it.

143
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:52,071
No, I didn't mean it like that!

144
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:54,159
I've overstepped my bounds.

145
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:55,333
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:06,665
What?

147
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,815
What's going on?

148
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,319
Yes, I understand.

149
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,285
There's a fire on the lower levels.

150
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:24,095
It can't be anything but an act of arson, of course.

151
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,122
Arson?

152
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:26,890
Tonight, of all nights?

153
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:28,903
They wish to empty the building.

154
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,156
Then it's an attack.

155
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,398
Saber's Master will want to take
down Lancer as soon as possible

156
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:38,920
to lift his spear's curse and make her whole.

157
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:42,428
Lancer, go downstairs now and defeat her.

158
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:44,478
Don't just drive her off this time.

159
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:45,959
Understood, Master.

160
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:51,833
Let's see to it that our honored guest enjoys
the amazing magical workshop of Kayneth El‐Melloi.

161
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:55,960
A perfect workshop requiring an entire floor.

162
00:10:56,332 --> 00:11:03,225
Twenty‐four layered barriers, three mana generators,
dozens of ghosts and spirits roaming as guard dogs.

163
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,741
Thousands of traps and parts of
hallways that open into other worlds.

164
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:15,694
We shall avail ourselves of all the
magical techniques we have at our disposal.

165
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:18,481
I shall make you retract your statements

166
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:21,196
that I am pathetic very shortly.

167
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:21,818
Oh?

168
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:23,398
I look forward to it.

169
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:32,107
Mr. Archibald!

170
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:35,626
Mr. Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald!

171
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,475
Are you present here?

172
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,025
Yes.

173
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:40,501
That was me.

174
00:11:40,818 --> 00:11:41,635
Don't worry.

175
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:49,180
Both Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald
and his wife Sola‐Ui have exited.

176
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:52,988
Hm.

177
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:54,201
Oh, I see.

178
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:56,058
Yes, yes, that's right.

179
00:11:58,144 --> 00:11:59,934
Everyone has evacuated.

180
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:00,801
Good.

181
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,365
Everything is ready on my end.

182
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:05,195
And you?

183
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,953
All green.

184
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,792
Just give the word.

185
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:47,898
Maiya?

186
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:50,371
The target never even moved from his position.

187
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,850
He didn't leave the hotel before the explosion.

188
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:55,445
A free fall from 150 meters.

189
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:59,100
No magical barrier known to man

190
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:01,271
could've saved him from that.

191
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,040
Maiya, withdraw.

192
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:23,478
To blow up the entire building...

193
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:28,480
I can't believe a mage would
actually do something like that.

194
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:33,959
Then again, I suppose he is
excellent at outsmarting mages.

195
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,934
Kirei Kotomine.

196
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:37,698
Oh?

197
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:39,793
I don't believe we've ever met.

198
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:44,379
Or do you have a good reason why
you would know who I am already?

199
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:47,651
Well, in that case, I can guess who you are.

200
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,541
Don't make me stand here doing all the talking, woman.

201
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,925
One word from you will suffice.

202
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:57,046
Tell me, where is the man who should have been here

203
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:58,430
instead of you?

204
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:09,412
Not bad, not bad at all.

205
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:11,469
You seem to have some training.

206
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:27,948
Hm.

207
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:38,530
There's no way she threw this gas canister.

208
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:49,924
No matter.

209
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:55,867
Just the knowledge that someone was here to save her
from the situation means tonight wasn't a total waste.

210
00:14:58,295 --> 00:14:59,345
Master Kirei.

211
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:03,484
I thought I gave you explicit orders to
stay hidden and not to expose yourself.

212
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:05,113
My apologies, Master.

213
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,120
But there is some important news that
I thought you should hear without delay.

214
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,013
We've located the Servant Caster.

215
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:17,765
After having Assassin perform a detailed investigation,

216
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:22,066
we learned that Caster and his Master
have kidnapped children from their beds

217
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,240
in the town of Miyama and the next town over.

218
00:15:25,453 --> 00:15:27,797
By dawn, they had taken fifteen.

219
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:29,258
I would imagine

220
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:34,450
that they are the serial killer that's been
reported in the news and that everyone is worried about.

221
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,467
They use magic without even the slightest hesitation,

222
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:41,958
and seem to be doing absolutely
nothing to hide their tracks.

223
00:15:42,586 --> 00:15:47,131
It is quite possible that they are
not even thinking of the Holy Grail War.

224
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,408
A mad Servant out of control

225
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,363
and a Master who doesn't even try to control him.

226
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:57,230
Why are people like them participating in the Grail War?

227
00:15:57,537 --> 00:16:00,114
This is something we cannot ignore, Tokiomi.

228
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:05,121
Their actions are in clear violation
of the rules by which we are all bound.

229
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:06,108
Of course.

230
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:10,403
As one responsible for guarding the
secrets of magic, this cannot be allowed.

231
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:15,143
Uh, we shall have to eliminate
Caster as well as his Master.

232
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,125
Yes.

233
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,977
But the problem is that defeating
a Servant requires a Servant,

234
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:23,816
and we can't send my Assassin
without exposing our deception.

235
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:25,261
Ah.

236
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:30,567
Minor rule changes fall completely under my purview.

237
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:34,390
We'll have all of the Masters
work as a group to defeat Caster.

238
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:40,399
Archer?

239
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:44,977
There are far fewer bottles here than
in Tokiomi's room, but of higher quality.

240
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:47,330
I must say that's some apprentice he has.

241
00:16:47,491 --> 00:16:48,982
What is it you want?

242
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:54,673
Apparently, there are those in this war other
than myself with an abundance of time on their hands.

243
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,078
What do you mean?

244
00:16:57,272 --> 00:17:00,992
Otherwise, a Master existing under
the kind protection of the Church

245
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,977
would hardly need to wander about.

246
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,988
I don't know what you're talking about.

247
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:09,607
Are you dissatisfied with your Master, Gilgamesh?

248
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:14,085
Tokiomi invited me to this
world and maintains my form here.

249
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:19,088
His greeting was worthy of my elevated station,
and so I felt that I had to respond to that.

250
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:23,593
But I never expected that he'd
be such a dull and boring person.

251
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:26,362
So you are unhappy with him as your Master.

252
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,072
He wants to reach the Vortex of the Root.

253
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:32,094
What a boring and tedious little plan.

254
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:38,810
The unflinching desire for the "Root" is unique to mages.

255
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,913
It's not for outsiders to comment upon.

256
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:47,635
In a sense, the path to the "Root" is
the path to an escape from this world.

257
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,363
For us, who are interested only in the world itself,

258
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:53,826
it may well be a tedious plan.

259
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:55,925
Is that so?

260
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:57,221
True.

261
00:17:57,408 --> 00:18:00,756
I am full of love for this universe
that is my personal playground.

262
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:04,571
I have no interest in realms outside my dominion.

263
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:07,603
This "Root" of yours does not concern me in the least.

264
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,596
Perhaps.

265
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,637
But the Grail is not a device
specifically designed to seek the Root.

266
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:14,987
When we say that it is omnipotent,

267
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:20,062
we mean that it has limitless potential to
alter even the reality of the material world.

268
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:22,390
So you're saying the other Masters

269
00:18:22,465 --> 00:18:26,504
have motives other than Tokiomi's
for wanting to obtain the Holy Grail.

270
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:28,837
Tokiomi is an archetypal mage,

271
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,632
and at the same time extremely orthodox.

272
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:37,118
What the other Masters seek is one form or
another of success here in the material world:

273
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:40,038
prestige, desires, power.

274
00:18:40,315 --> 00:18:41,646
That suits me fine.

275
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,908
I love every one of those things.

276
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:47,914
You are a king who rules over the profane and the vulgar,

277
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,399
Gilgamesh.

278
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,106
So what is it that motivates you, Kirei?

279
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:01,238
What do you want from the Holy Grail?

280
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:02,491
Me?

281
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:03,903
Nothing.

282
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,491
I have no real desire for it.

283
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:08,500
I seriously doubt that.

284
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:14,028
Doesn't the Holy Grail call only those
Masters whom it considers worthy of possessing it?

285
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,376
So they say.

286
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,449
But why did it choose me?

287
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:20,088
I have no ideal or other desire.

288
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:22,339
So why choose me for this battle?

289
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,127
No ideal or other desire?

290
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,064
Then why not simply wish for something like joy?

291
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,380
Ridiculous!

292
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,510
Wish for joy?

293
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:34,190
You'd ask me to long for something
that blasphemous and sinful?

294
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:37,134
Blasphemous and sinful you say?

295
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,040
That's going a little far, isn't it?

296
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,644
Why the connection between joy and sin?

297
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,239
Well, I...

298
00:19:45,371 --> 00:19:49,032
True, joy gained by evil means could be considered sin.

299
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:52,227
But joy may be attained through good deeds as well.

300
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:55,884
What kind of philosophy calls joy itself a sin?

301
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:57,730
It's absolutely ludicrous.

302
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:00,851
Joy is another quality that I lack.

303
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:03,984
I seek it, but never find it.

304
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:06,756
Kirei Kotomine,

305
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:10,637
I find myself interested in you.

306
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:12,877
What do you mean?

307
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,498
Exactly what I said.

308
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:16,678
Be seated.

309
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:24,788
True joy, you see,

310
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:27,381
might be thought of as a form of the soul.

311
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:30,607
The question isn't whether it exists or not,

312
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:32,362
but whether you know it.

313
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:37,272
Kirei, you have yet to see what form your soul has taken.

314
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:41,590
That's what it actually means when
you claim that you lack joy in your life.

315
00:20:41,797 --> 00:20:43,402
You're just a mere Servant

316
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:45,517
and you dare sit there and lecture me?

317
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,155
Don't get cocky, mongrel.

318
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:51,365
I am a king who has tasted all
the pleasures the world has to offer.

319
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:53,478
Hold your tongue and listen.

320
00:20:55,857 --> 00:20:59,018
Kirei, you ought to learn what pleasure is.

321
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:01,073
Look first to the outside.

322
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:02,815
I know.

323
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:06,076
Why not begin by joining me in my entertainment?

324
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:11,251
I have no time to waste on pointless trivialities.

325
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,885
Don't be like that.

326
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,251
You can do it between the jobs Tokiomi assigns you.

327
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:23,436
To begin with, your task is to keep watch
over the five other Masters, isn't that correct?

328
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:25,055
What of it?

329
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:30,472
You should investigate not only their plans, but
their motivations for obtaining the Grail as well.

330
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:32,560
Then give that information to me.

331
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:36,790
That would be possible if I ask the Assassins.

332
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,937
But, Archer, what does any of that matter to you?

333
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:43,099
I've already told you.

334
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:44,958
I enjoy watching humans.

335
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:49,341
One or two of them are sure to be interesting
enough to keep me entertained for a while.

336
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:52,523
Compared to that dull Tokiomi at least.

337
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:56,181
Very well, Archer.

338
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:57,321
I will accept.

339
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:00,380
But it will take some time to do it.

340
00:22:00,532 --> 00:22:01,427
That's fine.

341
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:02,960
I shall wait patiently

342
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:06,125
as I avail myself of these drinks.

343
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,305
My reason for seeking the Holy Grail?

344
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:17,233
I said far more than I should have.

345
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:22,200
I know that it certainly isn't joy.

346
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,188
However, if I can learn about him,

347
00:22:33,905 --> 00:22:36,276
will I also be able to learn

348
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,062
what it is I seek as well?

349
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:44,576
Kiritsugu Emiya.

350
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,320
I am temporarily altering the rules of the Grail War.

351
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:23,786
Could eventually kill yourself.

352
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:25,644
We could escape if we go now.

353
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:28,081
It will be my lance alone that takes Saber's life.

354
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:30,606
My fight with you is no longer over the Grail!

355
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:32,800
Don't get conceited, you savage!
