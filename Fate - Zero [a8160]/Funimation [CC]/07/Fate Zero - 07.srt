1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,707
This way, sir.

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,728
What is that?

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,124
All of you, return to your post.

4
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,730
Looks like an enormous ball of mercury doesn't it?

5
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,240
It's almost as if the damn thing is alive.

6
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:30,082
I need to get this out of here...

7
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:31,767
What's the matter, is something wrong?

8
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:32,830
I need to get this out of here,

9
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,380
I need to get this out of here.

10
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:34,949
Sir?

11
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:37,011
Load that thing onto the truck!

12
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:38,191
Quickly!

13
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:13,758
I'm afraid I must inform you that
the Grail War is in grave peril.

14
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:19,295
We have identified Caster's master as the
person behind the recent kidnappings in Fuyuki,

15
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:21,703
a disturbing revelation, indeed.

16
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:26,843
Thus, in accordance with the emergency
powers granted to me as overseer,

17
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,917
I am temporarily altering the rules of the Grail War.

18
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:34,760
Masters are to hereby cease all
ongoing combat in pursuit of the grail

19
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,906
and focus on the elimination of Caster instead.

20
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:42,454
And the one who succeeds in
defeating Caster and his master

21
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:46,154
will receive an additional Command Seal as their reward.

22
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:52,828
These are the unused Command Seals left
behind by the fallen masters of past grail wars.

23
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:57,727
One of them should prove to be of
immeasurable value to whoever receives it.

24
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:01,765
Once Caster's destruction has been positively confirmed,

25
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:05,436
the Holy Grail War will recommence until a victor emerges.

26
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:08,233
Now then, if anyone has questions,

27
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:09,909
please ask them now.

28
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:15,497
But, of course, that offer is limited to
those who can actually speak in human languages.

29
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:21,484
Well played, Father.

30
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:25,997
Now all the masters will do whatever
they can to hunt him down and destroy him.

31
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:31,312
There were five familiars gathered at the
church for my announcement, which means that...

32
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:37,739
Which means that the elusive missing master
Lord El‐Melloi is still very much alive.

33
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,764
Indeed.

34
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:41,823
And the offer of a Command Seal as the reward

35
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,459
should draw him out

36
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,049
given that he's already used one of his.

37
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:49,520
Of course, the other masters will be drawn out as well.

38
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:52,635
They'll seek to keep the Command Seal from the rest

39
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,871
by making certain they can claim it for themselves.

40
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,507
That's true, but it also means
that the master who wins the seal

41
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:03,401
will gain a formidable advantage over the others.

42
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:05,599
Naturally, it's not ideal.

43
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:08,147
Once Caster has been thoroughly weakened

44
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:11,575
and is on the run from all the
other masters who are chasing him,

45
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:16,160
Archer must be the one to deal the final blow.

46
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,740
Um...

47
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:21,961
Excuse me, is this the Mackenzie residence?

48
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:23,144
I have a delivery.

49
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:26,844
Yes, that is the name of this domicile's residents.

50
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:32,514
Well, then, might there be a
Mr. Iskandar, King of Conquerors here?

51
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,200
That would be me.

52
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,781
I see, right.

53
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,247
I should've known.

54
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,749
Uh, could I have your signature on this receipt here?

55
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:43,076
My signature?

56
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:44,220
Very well.

57
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:48,442
You have my thanks.

58
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,783
Well, thank you very much for your business, sir.

59
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,926
To have the entire world emblazoned across my chest.

60
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:01,999
What a great feeling!

61
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:06,057
Wait, why are you dressed like that?

62
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:08,205
The package I was awaiting arrived.

63
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:10,643
So you went outside the house?

64
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,584
Ta‐da, I merely tried out that
mail‐order thing I heard about.

65
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,437
But I told you that you were
never to leave the second floor!

66
00:05:17,553 --> 00:05:22,435
If the residents are not at home and you are
off somewhere all day occupied with your familiar,

67
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:24,605
who else is there to answer the door?

68
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,233
I had no choice.

69
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:30,094
A summons to appear by the Holy
Church is a big deal and I had to go.

70
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:31,547
Don't be so grouchy.

71
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,818
After seeing Saber last night,

72
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:35,661
I came to a realization.

73
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:41,961
If one wears modern attire, there should be no
issue whatsoever with going outside the domicile.

74
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,298
Hey, wait!

75
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:44,434
Stop!

76
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:47,215
At least put on some pants before you go out!

77
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,327
Oh, yes, leggings.

78
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:53,928
That's true, I forgot. Everyone in this land wears them.

79
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:55,834
Do I have to wear them?

80
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:57,607
Yes, of course you have to!

81
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,219
And just to be perfectly clear,

82
00:05:59,296 --> 00:06:02,573
I'm definitely not going to make
a special trip all the way to town

83
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:05,591
just to buy you a pair of triple XL pants, understand?

84
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:06,879
You won't, why?

85
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:11,082
Boy, would you actually stand in the
way of my triumphant conquest of the world?

86
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:13,698
You conquering the world and
whether or not you have pants have

87
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:16,579
nothing, not even the slightest
thing to do with each other!

88
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,479
Before you start planning to go screwing around outside,

89
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:22,649
why don't you go out and do your
job and beat one of the other servants?

90
00:06:22,903 --> 00:06:25,461
Then I'll buy your pants or anything else you want.

91
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:26,352
Very well.

92
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:27,885
I understand.

93
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:31,412
Do you swear that once I defeat one of the other servants

94
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:35,734
you will go and buy me a modern
pair of pants so that I can go outside?

95
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:37,473
Unbelievable.

96
00:06:37,753 --> 00:06:41,534
You really want to put on modern
clothes and go walking outside that much?

97
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:44,118
The King of Knights was walking around outside.

98
00:06:44,252 --> 00:06:46,865
I simply cannot allow myself to be undone.

99
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,422
I like the design on this shirt.

100
00:06:49,574 --> 00:06:52,139
It is fitting attire for a strong ruler.

101
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:55,754
Look, we have to go find and defeat Caster too.

102
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:58,107
What the hell are we doing?

103
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:01,929
There is a powerful barrier over Mount Enzo

104
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,843
with Ryuudou Temple at its center.

105
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,498
Because of that, except for natural spirits like servants,

106
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:10,182
anything can enter only via the temple path.

107
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:13,425
Keep that in mind as you're using Saber.

108
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:16,785
There are three other spots where the ley lines converge:

109
00:07:16,943 --> 00:07:18,652
Tohsaka Manor, Fuyuki Chapel,

110
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:22,568
and this new residential area, east of the city center.

111
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:26,939
Consequently, this means that
there are four locations in Fuyuki

112
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:30,713
that have all the spiritual characteristics
needed for the grail to appear.

113
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:32,866
In the war's second phase,

114
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,496
when there are fewer servants left in the fight,

115
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:37,737
we'll have to secure one of these spots

116
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,993
as our base of operations, won't we?

117
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:41,253
Yes, that's correct.

118
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:43,901
Well, that just about covers the lay of the land.

119
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:45,419
Are there any questions?

120
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:48,247
Is there anything that you aren't clear on?

121
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:49,932
I understand perfectly.

122
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:52,379
It was an adequate explanation.

123
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,908
Kiritsugu, can we assume that all
the other masters will go after Caster?

124
00:07:58,298 --> 00:07:59,559
It's a safe bet.

125
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:03,676
However, we have an advantage
as far as Caster is concerned.

126
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:05,725
In his madness,

127
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:09,689
he believes that our Saber is actually his Jeanne d'Arc

128
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,406
which is to our benefit.

129
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:14,170
We need only wait for him to come to us.

130
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:16,585
But, master, that is not enough.

131
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,763
His evil deeds must be punished.

132
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,733
We should take the fight straight to him

133
00:08:20,844 --> 00:08:22,665
before he can do any more damage.

134
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:30,291
Iri, do you have a handle on this forest's barrier spells?

135
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,182
Yes, I do, however,

136
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:36,226
our real problem is the unbreakable
curse on Saber's left hand.

137
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,588
Eighteen hours have already
passed since your defeat of Canaan,

138
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,242
but Saber's wound has still yet to heal.

139
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:47,214
Lancer must still be alive.

140
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:53,196
Shouldn't we go find and defeat Lancer first so we
can face a battle with Caster at our full strength?

141
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,976
That isn't necessary.

142
00:08:55,628 --> 00:09:00,833
You just need to use your knowledge of the area
to confuse the enemy, keeping Saber moving around.

143
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:04,675
You won't have her fight Caster?

144
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:07,829
No, someone else will deal with him even if we don't.

145
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:13,000
The masters and servants hunting Caster in
a frenzy will make excellent targets for us.

146
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,760
I'll attack from their flanks and take them out.

147
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:19,294
Master, you can't.

148
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:22,702
To what depths do you intend to sink in your pursuit?

149
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:25,482
You do insult to heroic spirits.

150
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:28,136
Why do you not allow me to go out and fight?

151
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,510
Do you mean to imply that you cannot trust me,

152
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:31,866
your own servant?

153
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:36,198
There's a truce against everyone but Caster, isn't there?

154
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,813
It'll be fine.

155
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,189
This overseer of ours can't be trusted.

156
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:45,686
He harbors Assassin's master in his church
and doesn't say anything about it to anyone.

157
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:48,435
He may also be working with Tohsaka.

158
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,882
We should be skeptical of his actions.

159
00:09:51,618 --> 00:09:53,542
All right, dismissed.

160
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:00,751
Kiritsugu.

161
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:05,386
If...

162
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:07,966
If I...

163
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:13,001
If I decided to abandon everything
and simply run away from all of this,

164
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:17,343
Iri, would you consider coming with me?

165
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:19,220
But what about Illya?

166
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:21,561
She's still waiting back at our castle.

167
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,189
I'd return for her, killing anyone in our way,

168
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:27,054
and then I would just...

169
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:29,651
I'd give all I have

170
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:32,298
for you and Illya, and no one else!

171
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:35,633
Could we really get away?

172
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,412
We could escape if we go now!

173
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:41,001
You're lying.

174
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:42,797
That's a lie.

175
00:10:44,758 --> 00:10:46,760
You could never run away from this.

176
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,017
You would never forgive yourself

177
00:10:49,218 --> 00:10:51,424
for abandoning the Holy Grail,

178
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:54,007
for failing to save the world.

179
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:58,865
You would be riddled with guilt,
and as your first and final accuser,

180
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,987
you would eventually kill yourself.

181
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,644
I'm scared.

182
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:10,593
He... Kirei Kotomine is after me.

183
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:13,159
Maiya told me.

184
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:16,130
He used Canaan as bait to draw me out.

185
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:18,712
He anticipated my actions.

186
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:21,763
I've already sacrificed you, Iri,

187
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:23,741
and I've left Illya behind,

188
00:11:24,088 --> 00:11:27,540
but the most dangerous of them
all has already set his sights on me,

189
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:30,971
the one that I had hoped to never cross paths with!

190
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:35,675
I won't allow you to fight alone.

191
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:39,393
I will protect you, and Saber will, too,

192
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:42,825
and also Maiya is here.

193
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:48,014
Kiritsugu.

194
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:50,906
An attack.

195
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:54,496
We're lucky I hadn't sent Maiya out yet.

196
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,174
We can mount an all‐out defense.

197
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:03,855
Iri, find us a remote‐viewing crystal ball.

198
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:11,155
There they are.

199
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:13,348
Irisviel.

200
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:15,722
He's trying to lure us out.

201
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:18,710
It looks like he has hostages.

202
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,729
I'll have to go out there and do what I can to save them.

203
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:27,905
He knows that we're watching him.

204
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,566
Just as I promised you last night, I,
Gilles de Rais, have come for you, my darling.

205
00:12:33,762 --> 00:12:39,479
I wish to see you, fair Jeanne, my enchanting
and radiantly beautiful holy virgin of my dreams.

206
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:40,817
Irisviel.

207
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:43,268
You may take your time if you wish.

208
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:49,552
I have come fully prepared for a lengthy wait, and
will be as attentive and patient as you need for me to be.

209
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:54,575
Now, children, it's time for
us to play some hide‐and‐seek.

210
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:55,948
The rules are simple.

211
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,474
You need only to elude me.

212
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:59,863
But if I find you...

213
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:01,602
No, don't!

214
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:07,941
Run, children.

215
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:10,353
When I count to a hundred, the chase begins.

216
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:15,794
Well, Jeanne, how long do you think it will
take for me to catch them all and win the game?

217
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:21,760
Saber, go!

218
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,183
Defeat Caster!

219
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:24,216
Yes!

220
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:33,321
Huh?

221
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:51,006
Welcome, fair Jeanne.

222
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,881
How do you like this horrible sight?

223
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,790
Does it not pain you?

224
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:00,890
Do you despise me, Jeanne?

225
00:14:01,863 --> 00:14:04,098
Yes, I'm sure you must.

226
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:08,718
I'm certain you'll never forgive
me for turning from God's love.

227
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,545
Unhand the child, monster!

228
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:20,843
Jeanne, if you so dearly wish to save the boy,
then, child, you should rejoice and be exceedingly glad.

229
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:25,720
God's devout messenger says that she will
save you from the fate of your departed friend.

230
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,385
It's dangerous here.

231
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:34,715
Now, you need to run.

232
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:38,313
Just follow this path and you'll find a castle.

233
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:57,281
Ha‐ha, do you not remember what I told you?

234
00:14:57,642 --> 00:15:00,132
I said that the very next time we would meet

235
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,162
I would be prepared for you.

236
00:15:02,963 --> 00:15:04,125
Very well.

237
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:06,929
My fight with you is no longer over.

238
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,337
The Grail!

239
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:21,618
Oh, my fair Jeanne, how noble, how beautiful!

240
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:26,097
Oh, holy virgin, even God's beauty pales before you.

241
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,953
Caster, I take up my sword solely to destroy you!

242
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:30,865
Prepare!

243
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:53,842
If only I could use my left hand.

244
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:57,505
Even Caster's mana isn't infinite.

245
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:00,325
If she can last until it runs out,

246
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,365
Saber can with this battle, right, Kiritsugu?

247
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:09,044
More importantly, there's still no
sign of other masters entering the forest.

248
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,302
Maiya, take Iri and get away from the castle

249
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,972
in the opposite direction of the fight.

250
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,043
But why can't I just remain here?

251
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:22,654
With Saber fighting away from you,
it simply isn't safe for you here.

252
00:16:23,312 --> 00:16:26,913
At least one of the other masters
is certain to have had the same idea.

253
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:30,304
All right, I'll go.

254
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:35,034
What's wrong, Iri?

255
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:38,895
It appears that another one has arrived.

256
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,379
How is this?

257
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:46,696
Is there no end to his mana?

258
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:48,944
Impossible.

259
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:51,033
The source of his mana is...

260
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:53,758
So that book is your Noble Phantasm?

261
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:58,009
That's right, the grimoire left to
me by the legendary teacher, Prelati,

262
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:02,308
gives me the ample means to command
a demonic legion to do my will.

263
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,571
What do you think, my fair Jeanne?

264
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:06,883
It brings back memories, doesn't it?

265
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,173
Everything is just as it was then.

266
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:15,319
Your indomitable warrior spirit and noble bearing
proves you to be none other than Jeanne d'Arc!

267
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:19,428
So why, fair Jeanne, why do you
not awaken to the truth of this?

268
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:23,065
Do you still believe in God's grace even now?

269
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:27,124
Faced with mortal peril, you still
believe a miracle will save you?

270
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:31,717
How terribly tragic. Have you
forgotten the Battle of Compiègne?

271
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:37,508
Even after that awful humiliation,
you still chose to remain God's puppet!

272
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:51,756
Ah!

273
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:57,062
Rather pathetic.

274
00:17:57,335 --> 00:18:00,865
Such swordsmanship is unworthy
of the title King of Knights.

275
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:01,757
Hmm.

276
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:03,838
Who are you?

277
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:07,168
And who gave you leave to
interfere with our private affair?

278
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:10,179
Yes, well, that is my question to you, monster.

279
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,798
It will be my lance alone that takes Saber's life.

280
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:16,359
Ah, no, it was my prayer!

281
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:19,632
It was my Holy Grail that brought her back to life!

282
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:22,123
She is mine, intruder.

283
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:27,251
Every scrap of flesh, every drop of
blood, even her very soul belongs to me!

284
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:32,480
Listen, Caster, I am not gonna comment
on your bizarre notion of romance here.

285
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,093
So if you really believe that you're
gonna make Saber yours here today,

286
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:37,628
then go ahead and try it,

287
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:44,446
but know that I, Diarmuid, will never allow you
to defeat a crippled Saber in any sort of battle

288
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:45,853
before I can!

289
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:49,094
You came to help?

290
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:51,397
Don't get the wrong idea.

291
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:56,283
The only thing that brought me here today
was the order to find and defeat Caster.

292
00:18:56,711 --> 00:19:00,995
And, so, I believe cooperation is our best option, right?

293
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:02,584
Mmhmm.

294
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:06,119
Just to be perfectly clear, Lancer,

295
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:10,459
right now, I could kill a hundred
of those things with just my left arm.

296
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:13,946
Hmm, a mere hundred of them is child's play.

297
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:17,894
You will pay.

298
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,421
Don't be conceited, you savage!

299
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,214
Fervor, mei sanguis.

300
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:37,168
Kayneth El‐Melloi has arrived,

301
00:19:37,382 --> 00:19:39,781
the ninth patriarch of the Archibald family.

302
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:44,659
Mage of the Einzbern, come forth and let
us duel for possession of the Holy Grail

303
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,832
with our lives and our sacred honor.

304
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:20,479
Mechanical traps, of all things.

305
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,430
Have you fallen so low, Einzbern?

306
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:28,002
Very well, then this is no
longer a duel, but an extermination.

307
00:20:37,713 --> 00:20:38,662
I see.

308
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:40,994
Automated probes.

309
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:50,813
I found you, pathetic rat.

310
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:56,513
Now scalp!

311
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:00,516
Time alter, double accelerate.

312
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:07,238
Huh?

313
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:08,589
Oh.

314
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:15,484
He manipulated the flow of time to greatly accelerate
himself by using his own body as a reality marble.

315
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,710
It seems that he knows a little magic after all.

316
00:21:18,932 --> 00:21:25,193
Still, only a miserable, little coward would
depend on petty tricks after being trained as a mage.

317
00:21:25,574 --> 00:21:28,524
Perhaps dying will teach him his place.

318
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:31,927
Ire sanctio.

319
00:21:34,872 --> 00:21:39,653
If he's manipulating his inner time, it
must be placing enormous stress on his body.

320
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:44,247
I found him.

321
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:48,543
Now then, how far can you run as exhausted as you are?

322
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:01,787
Time alter, triple stagnate.

323
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:10,789
These things don't have eyes.

324
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:14,460
If I can slow my internal time to a third

325
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:18,612
and lower my pulse and respiration as far as they can go,

326
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:21,274
they can't sense me.

327
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:35,477
Kayneth!

328
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:39,384
You're a fool!

329
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:40,957
It's a waste of time.

330
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:47,578
Hmm.

331
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:22,377
Maiya, no!

332
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:25,100
You're a disgrace to mages everywhere.

333
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,790
Tremble down to your soul! Sink into despair!

334
00:24:27,818 --> 00:24:30,113
Strike him, Jeanne d'Arc!

335
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:32,507
By whose order do you dare attack?

336
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:35,020
Prepare to die, monster.
