1
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:08,401
Madam?

2
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:09,180
Huh?

3
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:11,937
Please hurry.

4
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:20,617
Madam?

5
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:23,470
Another intruder has just arrived.

6
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:26,117
They're waiting for us in the direction we're headed.

7
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:28,810
We'll run into them if we go this way.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,105
Understood.

9
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:32,797
Let's circle around to the north side then.

10
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:37,032
Madam?

11
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:38,963
The one who is coming is...

12
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:42,545
Kirei Kotomine.

13
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,488
Kirei Kotomine.

14
00:02:21,617 --> 00:02:25,245
Maiya, the orders that were given to you by Kiritsugu

15
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:27,945
were to protect me from harm, right?

16
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:28,859
Yes.

17
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:30,901
But...

18
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:31,812
But what?

19
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:34,889
We mustn't let him get to Kiritsugu,

20
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,257
no matter what we have to do to stop him.

21
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:39,952
Isn't that what you're thinking?

22
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:45,717
Madam, how did you...

23
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:47,226
What a coincidence.

24
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,691
I was thinking the very same thing.

25
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:53,077
Maiya, Kirei Kotomine

26
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:55,499
represents the most dangerous threat

27
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:58,072
that Kiritsugu has ever had to face.

28
00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:01,464
You and I are going to hold him off here.

29
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:03,664
Understood, Maiya?

30
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:07,026
I apologize.

31
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:10,505
But, please prepare yourself, madam.

32
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:11,539
I will.

33
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:13,867
Please don't worry about me.

34
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,481
Do whatever you think you have to do,

35
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,318
what you believe to be necessary to win,

36
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:21,922
and not what Kiritsugu ordered you to do.

37
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:22,844
Right.

38
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,516
What's funny?

39
00:03:28,611 --> 00:03:32,177
Isn't the human heart a funny thing?

40
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:46,521
Hmm, you repeat an attack you
know to be absolutely futile.

41
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:02,657
Scalp!

42
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:23,028
He was somehow able to breach
Volumen Hydragyrum's autonomous defense?

43
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:25,006
He couldn't have.

44
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:29,820
His ineffective childish attack
simply rolled me into lowering my guard!

45
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:35,780
I shall take steps to provide for a much
swifter, more efficient defense from now on.

46
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,007
You're disgrace to mages everywhere,

47
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,891
you piece of lowborn trash!

48
00:04:42,434 --> 00:04:44,249
For spilling my blood,

49
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:47,077
you will pay with your life.

50
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:55,165
He knows exactly how powerful this is now.

51
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:57,533
It's not going to work on him twice.

52
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:02,171
Next time, he'll channel all his mana into his defense.

53
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:07,781
Yes, that exactly what I need him to do.

54
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:22,810
Huh?

55
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:34,891
An illusion?

56
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:53,250
Maiya, no!

57
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:24,151
Madam, please don't.

58
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:28,381
Woman, this may come as a surprise to you,

59
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,273
but I haven't come here to
this place in order to defeat you.

60
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:35,929
I'm well aware of that, Kirei Kotomine.

61
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:41,008
I know what you desire, but I will not allow it.

62
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:45,042
You will never reach Kiritsugu Emiya tonight or ever!

63
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:47,046
We will stop you...

64
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:49,022
...right here.

65
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:50,063
Madam!

66
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:51,821
He's a skilled executioner!

67
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:53,581
An expert at hunting mages!

68
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,471
Regular magic won't be enough to stop him!

69
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:03,730
Kiritsugu taught me a lot more than how to drive a car!

70
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:09,982
He taught me to live and to survive! Shape ist Leben!

71
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,487
Look out!

72
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:40,747
Not so fast!

73
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:54,450
Maiya!

74
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:57,484
Finish him!

75
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:10,194
It can't be.

76
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,252
Hm.

77
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,847
You bastard... ah!

78
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:03,704
I'm honestly stunned

79
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,867
that we've made so little progress with these things.

80
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,037
It's that grimoire, Lancer.

81
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:13,104
As long as he holds that Noble Phantasm,

82
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:15,034
our situation will not improve.

83
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:17,418
I see, so that's his secret.

84
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:24,099
Of course, if you plan to go over and knock the
book from that pale freak's hands, you've got a problem.

85
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:27,079
You'll need to get pass his big wall of monsters first.

86
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:30,455
Well, then, what say you to taking in

87
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,893
all‐or‐nothing gamble?

88
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:37,489
It feels a bit shameful, but there's no
glory in simply fighting these ugly things.

89
00:09:37,863 --> 00:09:40,748
Very well, count me in, Saber.

90
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:42,718
I shall clear a path for you.

91
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:45,046
We will have but one chance at this.

92
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,437
Lancer, can you run on the wind?

93
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:50,194
I understand.

94
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:51,941
It's child's play.

95
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,308
How delightful!

96
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:55,104
Have you two said your prayers?

97
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,600
Tremble down to your soul! Sink into despair!

98
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,550
Superior skill can only defeat so many before
being completely overwhelmed by sheer numbers.

99
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,341
It must be humiliating!

100
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:10,988
You will die!

101
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:15,737
Suffocated under a horde of monsters
that know nothing of honor or glory!

102
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:19,232
There can be no greater disgrace for a hero!

103
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,768
Oh, that beautiful face of yours.

104
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:27,265
Make it twist and contort in pain for me, Jeanne!

105
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:33,308
Strike Air!

106
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:39,490
Ah!

107
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:43,883
Prepare to die!

108
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:49,118
Strike him, Gae Dearg!

109
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:51,172
Ahh!

110
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,257
Damn you.

111
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:18,807
Damn you, damn you, damn you, damn you, damn you!

112
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:21,214
Damn you!

113
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,083
Did you like that?

114
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:26,649
Had Saber had the use of her left hand,

115
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,565
well, you would've experienced the same.

116
00:11:31,736 --> 00:11:33,015
Prepare to die...

117
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:35,861
...monster.

118
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:53,280
Pathetic.

119
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:59,405
I didn't come here and join the Holy Grail War
only to fight in this ridiculous sort of battle!

120
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:11,252
Where is he?

121
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:12,202
Find him.

122
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,402
There you are...

123
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,102
...you skulking little rat.

124
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:34,666
Surely you don't expect the same trick to
work on me a second time, do you, lowborn scum?

125
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:42,284
The fact that you succeeded in landing a single
blow wasn't due to any great strategy of yours.

126
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:43,476
It was a fluke.

127
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,376
A stroke of luck, plain and simple.

128
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:47,845
Now I'm going to teach you the difference.

129
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,401
I shan't let you die easily.

130
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:53,924
I shall use healing magic to
regenerate your heart and lungs

131
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:56,944
while I rend every millimeter of your lowborn flesh.

132
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:59,629
In excruciating pain and despair,

133
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,561
you will die as you suffer.

134
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,227
And while you die, you will curse them,

135
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:07,180
you will curse the cowardice of those who hired you.

136
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:11,081
You will curse the Einzbern for
making a mockery of the Grail War!

137
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,588
Insolent fool!

138
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:15,345
Fervor, mei sanguis!

139
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:18,286
Hm.

140
00:13:23,214 --> 00:13:25,631
I knew you'd do that, scum.

141
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:31,643
Hm.

142
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,146
Ah!

143
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:37,473
You struggle in vain!

144
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,478
Disgusting.

145
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:56,953
He is nothing but a sniveling coward!

146
00:13:58,156 --> 00:13:58,906
Lancer.

147
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:02,654
Is something wrong?

148
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:08,358
It's my master.

149
00:14:08,685 --> 00:14:09,898
He's in danger.

150
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:15,038
It seems, he left me here and breached the castle himself.

151
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:21,101
I'm certain that the danger comes from my own master.

152
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:25,000
Lancer, hurry to his side.

153
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,914
Go to your master as aid.

154
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:32,428
King of Knights, you have my thanks.

155
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:34,012
Think nothing of it.

156
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:37,537
You and I have sworn to settle matters
in a manner befitting two knights.

157
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:39,567
Let us keep our pride intact.

158
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:51,179
That must mean that all went
according to Kiritsugu's plan.

159
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,612
Your origin is based on cutting and tying, kid.

160
00:15:00,937 --> 00:15:02,364
To cut and tie.

161
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:08,926
The nuance is a little different
than destruction and regeneration.

162
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,984
If you cut a thread and then retie it,

163
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:14,311
it will always be thicker where you cut it.

164
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,247
Isn't that right?

165
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,428
In that sense,

166
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,705
it carries a connotation of irreversible change.

167
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,714
I've powdered some of your ribs,

168
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,375
and also put a very special part inside of here.

169
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:33,408
Your origin will materialize
in anything shot by these bullets.

170
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,708
It's especially powerful against mages.

171
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,409
If they attempt to use any magic against it,

172
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:45,425
your origin will interfere with and destroy
their magic circuits which will reconnect improperly.

173
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:50,796
The more powerful the mage, the more their
magic circuits will run haywire and short out.

174
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:54,028
Naturally, they will never be able to recover

175
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,047
either as a mage or human.

176
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:59,152
These will be your ace in the hole.

177
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:00,869
"Origin Rounds".

178
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:03,236
I've made 66 in total.

179
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:05,359
Don't waste them.

180
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:56,786
I'm sure you must know how easy it would
be for me to skewer you right now, correct?

181
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,709
Master of Saber.

182
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:02,245
So that's it, is it?

183
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:04,944
I shall not let you kill my master,

184
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:07,708
nor will I kill Saber's master.

185
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:11,951
Neither of us wish for our duel to be ended that way.

186
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,850
Never forget this.

187
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,702
The reason you survived our encounter

188
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:20,421
is the nobility demonstrated by the King of Knights.

189
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,111
Woman, I have one question.

190
00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:37,516
It appears to me that the two
of you came here to challenge me

191
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,261
with the intention of protecting Kiritsugu Emiya.

192
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:45,608
By whose order do you dare attack?

193
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,690
You do not possess Command Seals,

194
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,844
so you are not the Einzbern Master.

195
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:56,968
Most likely, you are a homunculus
charged with protecting the Grail vessel.

196
00:17:57,506 --> 00:17:59,684
There's no way that someone like that

197
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:04,421
would ever be stupid enough to risk
going to the front lines of the battle.

198
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:06,764
So I ask again.

199
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:08,591
Tell me now.

200
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:11,316
Who ordered you to fight me?

201
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:20,065
Hm.

202
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:23,909
Master Kirei.

203
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:27,944
Caster, as well as Lancer and his master,

204
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,891
have left the forest.

205
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:32,528
Saber will arrive shortly.

206
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,764
My lord, it is dangerous here.

207
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,861
Hm.

208
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:46,227
Fascinating.

209
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,284
So it's red after all.

210
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,147
Impossible.

211
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:07,534
Could these women have challenged me of
their own accord without being ordered to do so?

212
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:10,412
No.

213
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:13,495
Kiritsugu Emiya is like me.

214
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,250
He is alone and empty inside,

215
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:18,554
understood by no one.

216
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:23,226
He must be.

217
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:26,730
Irisviel!

218
00:19:27,848 --> 00:19:28,843
Irisviel!

219
00:19:29,324 --> 00:19:30,361
Can you hear me?

220
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:35,436
Saber.

221
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:36,883
Stay awake.

222
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:38,495
You must stay awake.

223
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:40,505
I'm going to call Kiritsugu.

224
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,445
Be strong until then.

225
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,564
Where is Kirei,

226
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:48,379
the enemy who was here just a minute ago?

227
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,088
He escaped.

228
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:52,995
Had I been only a second faster,

229
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,372
this would never have happened to you.

230
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:58,581
What happened to Maiya?

231
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:01,631
Her wounds are grave, but not life‐threatening.

232
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,913
I'm more concerned about you.

233
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,017
You've lost so much blood.

234
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:07,228
Huh?

235
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:11,809
Irisviel, how...

236
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:18,883
How can this be?

237
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:22,537
I want you to carry Avalon, Iri.

238
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:23,873
What?

239
00:20:24,286 --> 00:20:28,424
But, this is a Noble Phantasm
that heals its bearer's wounds.

240
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,038
I think you should keep it.

241
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:36,115
No, Iri, unless its original owner,
Saber, is nearby to supply it with mana,

242
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:38,760
the scabbard won't function at all.

243
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:42,662
You will be the one who'll be
working with Saber from now on.

244
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,005
So you should have it.

245
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:48,771
Keep it within you as a conceptual weapon.

246
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:52,115
Additionally, tell no one of this,

247
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:54,754
not even Saber herself.

248
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:06,869
From the moment you touched me, I felt Avalon's power.

249
00:21:08,076 --> 00:21:09,419
Thank you, Saber.

250
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,552
Kirei Kotomine.

251
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:19,916
That inquisitor is as dangerous as I imagined he'd be.

252
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:22,720
No, even more so.

253
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:24,738
We were lucky today.

254
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:27,909
But there's no telling what will happen next time.

255
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:33,422
All I know for certain is that I can't
let him get to Kiritsugu no matter what.

256
00:21:34,883 --> 00:21:39,232
But, I'm not the only one here who is protecting him.

257
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:42,781
Isn't that right, Maiya?

258
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:47,548
Next time, we'll win for sure.

259
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:51,192
We'll both protect Kiritsugu, okay?

260
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:31,508
Because my young master is in mortal peril!

261
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:34,222
Dignity is required even during battle.

262
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,558
I'm sorry, but I cannot consent.

263
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,840
Why don't you give the Command Seals to me?

264
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:41,566
Lancer's not the fine man you think he is!
