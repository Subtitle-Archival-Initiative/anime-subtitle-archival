1
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,303
Rider?

2
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,373
What the hell?

3
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,435
What do you think you're doing
breaking the shutter open like that?

4
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:33,225
Why didn't you go through in
spirit form like when you entered?

5
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:37,913
I cannot carry these things while I am in my spirit form.

6
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:40,541
And don't whine so much.

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,754
You sound like you're some kind
of common thief or street urchin.

8
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:46,676
Well, if you aren't a thief, then what the hell are you?

9
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:49,125
Something entirely different.

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,824
A cowardly thief sneaks away in the night full of fear.

11
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:56,537
If you stride away bursting with song proudly,

12
00:00:56,614 --> 00:00:58,887
then what you are is a conquering king!

13
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:02,080
Just what I needed... now get out of here!

14
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:04,325
Get lost... get lost now!

15
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:07,282
Very well... then I shall leave you to carry the spoils.

16
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:09,081
Try not to drop them.

17
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:15,995
Oh, man, why is this happening to me?

18
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,458
I... I don't get it.

19
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,115
The summoning worked, so why do I have to do all of this?

20
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,564
What's so important about these books, anyway?

21
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:06,021
It's important because we are preparing for war.

22
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,997
And one cannot wage war without having proper maps.

23
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:13,956
Hey, boy, where are Macedonia and Persia?

24
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,478
You can't talk to me like that!

25
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,475
I'm your master...

26
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:25,894
I am well aware of my status as
servant and yours as my master.

27
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,724
After all, we forged a pact, did we not?

28
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:30,306
Mhm.

29
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:35,756
But I'm interested in learning where
all my old territories are located.

30
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,692
I think they're here.

31
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:41,932
Hmm.

32
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:50,538
I spent my life conquering that
land, and look how puny it is!

33
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,384
Very well.

34
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,686
I can't wait to get started!

35
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:55,334
All right, then.

36
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:59,105
Where exactly on this map are we sitting right now, boy?

37
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:01,074
Here.

38
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,326
So, the other side of the round land.

39
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:05,306
Hmm.

40
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:07,168
Good news indeed.

41
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:10,190
This will guide us well in the coming battles.

42
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:11,785
Guide us well?

43
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,059
First, to the other side of the world,

44
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:16,894
due west, and we go as fast as we can.

45
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:20,043
And we shall conquer every land that we pass through!

46
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:22,959
I shall return to Macedonia in triumph,

47
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:26,793
and my people will hold a festival
in honor of my great revival!

48
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:30,201
Now how splendid will that be?

49
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,944
Why do you think you're here, anyway?

50
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:35,515
You didn't forget the Grail War, did you?

51
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:37,743
Hmm, that's right.

52
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,317
Speaking of the Grail, I have
neglected to ask one small thing.

53
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:44,501
What will you do with the Grail once you possess it?

54
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:47,145
Why... what's it to you what I do?

55
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,193
I mean, what do you care?

56
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,422
If you are also intent on world conquest,

57
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:54,472
then that would make you my enemy,

58
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:58,033
because the world cannot serve two lords.

59
00:04:58,235 --> 00:04:58,666
Wha...

60
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:01,030
No, I don't want that!

61
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,943
Look, I'll tell you what I really want, okay?

62
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:08,774
I just want people to treat me fairly.

63
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:14,006
I wanna make all those idiots back at the clock
tower who never even bothered to give me a chance

64
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:15,435
to admit to me that they were wrong!

65
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,501
Small!

66
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,722
Small.

67
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:22,193
And narrow‐minded and stupid!

68
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:26,986
You mean to tell me that in this battle, your
only concern is for your ridiculous reputation?

69
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:29,332
And you dare call yourself my master?

70
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:31,722
What a terrible disappointment you are.

71
00:05:33,786 --> 00:05:37,933
If you wish so desperately for
others to fear and respect you...

72
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:42,228
...perhaps you should try using the Holy Grail's power

73
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,485
to grow another 30 centimeters
and add a little bit of muscle.

74
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:53,066
He's supposed to be my servant!

75
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,046
He can't talk to me that way!

76
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,054
I'll show him!

77
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,246
I address the command seal.

78
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:03,170
In accordance with the Grail's laws,

79
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,356
I order this man, Iskander the Conqueror...

80
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:11,265
Calm down, Waver.

81
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:16,056
A master can only use his command seal to
compel his servant's obedience three times

82
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,083
and that's all.

83
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:21,775
If I use all my command seals, I won't be
able to control him when I really need to.

84
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,820
As long as I get the Holy Grail, it doesn't matter.

85
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,693
I really don't give a damn what you do after that, so...

86
00:06:32,738 --> 00:06:33,933
Enough, boy!

87
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,640
I shall acquire the Grail for you as you wish.

88
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:40,226
Yeah, well, you seem awfully confident about that.

89
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,263
Do you have any idea how you're gonna do it?

90
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:47,192
So you wish to see my power... is
that what you're trying to tell me?

91
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:49,806
Well, of course I do!

92
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:53,578
You need to prove to me that I can
rely on you no matter what the situation!

93
00:06:57,456 --> 00:07:03,166
I am Iskander, King of Conquerors! With
the swing of my sword, I declare my supremacy!

94
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:42,069
This is the ox chariot that King
Gordius once offered up to Zeus.

95
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:47,701
Its renowned reputation must be the source
of my designation as a rider class servant.

96
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:51,745
If you want the Grail, then find me another hero or two...

97
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:53,871
someone worthy for me to fight!

98
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:59,281
Until then, I shall entertain myself by
sitting here and looking at these maps.

99
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:01,656
That will not pose a problem, will it?

100
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:08,664
All right!

101
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:10,936
I'm not gonna lose today... you just watch!

102
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:19,774
Ah, I found one.

103
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:22,272
No way... where is it?

104
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,291
Oh, gee, I'm sure I didn't overlook it!

105
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:29,127
That's the very first chestnut bud today!

106
00:08:30,782 --> 00:08:32,040
First point to me.

107
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:35,299
I'm not gonna lose!

108
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:41,179
Oh, there's one!

109
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:42,362
Right here!

110
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:43,699
Ahhh.

111
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,451
You see... I found one too!

112
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:48,775
I found my second over here.

113
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,799
Huh?

114
00:08:51,683 --> 00:08:54,567
Hey, that isn't a chestnut branch.

115
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:56,020
It's kind of, Ilya.

116
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:58,817
That branch is actually from a tree called a wingnut.

117
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,630
It's almost like a chestnut,

118
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,531
so as far as I'm concerned, it's a chestnut bud.

119
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:05,461
Huh?

120
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:07,337
That's no fair!

121
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,394
No fair, no fair, no fair!

122
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:12,662
The whole time we've been playing, you've been cheating!

123
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:17,007
Yes, but your daddy can't win
this game against you otherwise!

124
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:21,626
If you keep on cheating like you've been
doing, I won't play this game with you ever again!

125
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:23,256
I don't want that!

126
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,684
I'm sorry, Ilya, I apologize.

127
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:28,648
Do you promise not to cheat like that anymore?

128
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:30,481
Yes, I do.

129
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:31,894
Okay then.

130
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,108
I challenge you to one more round.

131
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:37,132
A true champion accepts all challengers!

132
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,028
Indeed, I'm very honored, your highness.

133
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:44,610
Wow, I'm so high up!

134
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:51,624
What's got your attention out there, Saber?

135
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,226
It's interesting.

136
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:57,215
Your daughter and Kiritsugu are playing outside.

137
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:02,277
Are you surprised?

138
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:07,367
I was under the impression that my master
had a colder heart than he's showing now.

139
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:10,764
Well, I can see why you might think that.

140
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:16,933
If that really is Kiritsugu's true self,

141
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:22,100
then I am afraid I must've gravely
offended him when we first met.

142
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:26,699
Irisviel, you really don't have to laugh at me.

143
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:28,425
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:32,515
I was wondering if you're still concerned
with our reaction when you were summoned?

145
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:34,766
Yes, somewhat.

146
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:38,369
True, I did pretend to be a man during my original life.

147
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:42,110
But surely there was no need for you
two to be so shocked when you saw me.

148
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:46,418
I'm so sorry, but we just couldn't help it!

149
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:50,525
Your legend... I mean, King Arthur's legend

150
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:52,480
is extremely famous.

151
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:54,808
Well, if that's the case,

152
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,946
do you think he might underestimate my ability

153
00:10:58,182 --> 00:10:59,761
simply because I am a woman?

154
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:01,165
No, never.

155
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:02,420
Not at all.

156
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:06,555
Then again, if he's upset as you think he is,

157
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:08,818
I'm certain that there's another reason.

158
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:09,802
Such as?

159
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:14,865
He's probably upset at all the
people who were around you at the time.

160
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:20,204
The selfish ones, the ones
cruel enough and uncaring enough

161
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:23,714
to force the role of King upon an innocent little girl.

162
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:25,975
It was inevitable that would happen.

163
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:28,010
I had resigned myself to that fate

164
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:30,410
when I drew forth the sword from the stone.

165
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:35,226
I believe that that upsets him
even more than anything else,

166
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:37,246
your resignation to your fate.

167
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:40,948
Well, then he forgets his place.

168
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:45,529
He hasn't the right to question
decisions made by those of my time,

169
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:48,264
including those decisions I made myself.

170
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,321
That's why he says nothing about it to you.

171
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:54,669
I'm afraid that Kiritsugu Emiya,

172
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:58,526
and the hero Arturia will never get along with each other.

173
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:01,701
He must've resigned himself to that fact.

174
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:13,260
He wants to use the Holy Grail's power to save the world.

175
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:16,663
That is his ambition and yours, correct?

176
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:21,906
Yes, but you must understand that
I get my beliefs directly from him.

177
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:25,402
My own desire for the Grail is exactly the same.

178
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:32,281
It is my fervent wish to save Britain
since I could not protect it in life.

179
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:39,282
I think what you and Kiritsugu seek is
right and just, something to be proud of.

180
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:50,833
Our next match won't happen until you
come back from your trip to Japan, will it?

181
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:52,126
That's right.

182
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:56,663
How long do you think your work
will keep you and Mommy away from home?

183
00:12:56,802 --> 00:12:58,262
When will you come back?

184
00:12:58,962 --> 00:13:01,878
I should be back here in two weeks or so.

185
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:05,519
Your mom won't be back for quite a while, though.

186
00:13:06,207 --> 00:13:08,721
Yeah, Mommy told me about that already.

187
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:11,502
She said we'd be apart for a long time.

188
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:16,822
She also told me that even if we don't
see each other for a long, long time,

189
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:18,982
she'll always be right here by my side,

190
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:20,877
so I shouldn't ever feel lonely.

191
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:23,150
She told me that before I went to sleep.

192
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:25,390
I'm gonna be together with Mommy,

193
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:27,803
well, forever and ever and ever!

194
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,084
I see.

195
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:39,922
Listen, Ilya.

196
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:44,675
Daddy?

197
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:48,300
Can you wait for me, Ilya?

198
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:52,833
Even if you're lonely, can you last till I come home?

199
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:54,403
Mhm!

200
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,237
Good, then I promise you I'll be home

201
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:02,445
before you know it.

202
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,625
Fill, fill.

203
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:13,997
Fill her up, fill.

204
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:16,616
Repeat four times.

205
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:18,829
Or was it five times?

206
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:22,917
Um, and then I have to destroy it each time it's filled.

207
00:14:23,184 --> 00:14:24,599
Wait, is that right?

208
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:30,986
All right, now, fill and fill and fill and fill and fill.

209
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,887
Okay, that's five times.

210
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:34,039
Right!

211
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:39,770
At all three murder scenes,
officials tell us a mysterious pentagram

212
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,429
was found drawn in the victim's blood. Police speculate...

213
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:46,880
Do you think that maybe I went a little bit too far?

214
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:01,283
Hey, do you believe in terrible demons, kiddo?

215
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:07,216
All the newspapers and magazines right now
are saying I'm some kind of terrible demon.

216
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:11,209
But suppose demons like that
really did exist in the world.

217
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:13,647
I mean, wouldn't that be awfully rude to them?

218
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:16,253
You've gotta be pretty clear about these things.

219
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:19,609
Yo, I am Ryunosuke Uryu, and I am a demon!

220
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:22,734
Ah‐ha, I don't know if that's
the right way to go about it.

221
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:26,189
But look, I found this little baby!

222
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:29,502
It's some dusty old book from
deep inside our big storehouse.

223
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:35,158
Looks like some of my ancestors were doing a
bunch of research on how to go about summoning demons!

224
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:38,695
So, like, I've just gotta find
out if there really are demons!

225
00:15:38,844 --> 00:15:39,817
Understand?

226
00:15:40,014 --> 00:15:42,612
But you know, if a demon really did appear,

227
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:45,735
it would be pretty stupid of me
to just chat with it for a while

228
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,617
and then just send it back to
whatever pit of Hell it came from.

229
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:53,310
So, kid, if a demon does show up around here,

230
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,557
would you mind letting it kill ya?

231
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,085
I wonder what it's like being killed by a demon!

232
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:07,050
How many people get to find out?

233
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:11,808
Wait a minute, what's that?

234
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:40,082
I'll ask you, you who calls to me,

235
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:45,089
oh, summoner who manifests me
within the vessel of a caster,

236
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:47,748
I ask you your name.

237
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:48,921
Who?

238
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:51,776
Who art thou?

239
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:59,844
Um, uh, well, I'm Ryunosuke Uryu,
and I'm currently working odd jobs.

240
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:01,777
My hobby is murder of all varieties.

241
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:04,477
I really like kids and sometimes young women.

242
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:08,363
Very well, the pact is now officially sealed.

243
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:13,249
It's my irresistible desire to
possess the Holy Grail exactly as you do.

244
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:18,692
The sacred vessel of paradise, the cup
of awesome and terrible power will be ours!

245
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,805
The Holy... what?

246
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,290
Anyway, how would you like a little
snack just to kick things off right?

247
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,744
Here, wanna eat this kid?

248
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:38,509
Wow, that's human skin, isn't it?

249
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:12,479
Don't be frightened, little boy.

250
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:13,753
You'll be fine.

251
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:25,137
Can you stand?

252
00:18:27,013 --> 00:18:28,925
All right, now, little boy.

253
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:31,822
You can leave the room through that door right over there.

254
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:33,575
You think you can manage that?

255
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:42,014
Hey, what are you doing?

256
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:43,860
Shh.

257
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:16,746
Terror has its degrees of freshness.

258
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:18,579
The more intense the fear,

259
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:21,642
the more all of the other emotions die.

260
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:27,466
Terror, in its truest sense, is not a
static state, but rather a dynamic one.

261
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,462
It is the sublime moment when
shining hope turns to utter despair.

262
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:35,353
Did you enjoy that?

263
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,645
The tantalizing flavor of fresh terror and bloody death?

264
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:43,695
Cool!

265
00:19:43,804 --> 00:19:45,149
You are awesome!

266
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,268
You are the coolest thing ever!

267
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:52,880
Okay, look, I don't know anything about this
Grail crap, but from this moment on, I am with you.

268
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:54,052
Let's go kill!

269
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:58,423
I want you to take me out and show me
even cooler ways to torture and kill!

270
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:01,525
Ah... the name is Ryunosuke, correct?

271
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:06,890
What a magnificent omen to be blessed with
such an understanding master like yourself.

272
00:20:06,992 --> 00:20:10,942
I feel my darkest dream is nearly within my grasp.

273
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:13,909
Oh, hey, I didn't get your name.

274
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,006
What is it?

275
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:17,047
You wish to know my name.

276
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,921
Let me see now, in this era, the
most common name for me would be, uh...

277
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,571
perhaps for now I'll just call myself Bluebeard.

278
00:20:34,054 --> 00:20:36,106
The church contacted me.

279
00:20:36,423 --> 00:20:40,701
They said that the seventh servant,
a caster has finally appeared.

280
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,760
The final servant has been summoned?

281
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,247
Then it's time.

282
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:46,760
Indeed.

283
00:20:47,282 --> 00:20:51,528
You are to leave here now, and
head immediately to Tohsaka Manor.

284
00:20:52,574 --> 00:20:54,476
And once I arrive?

285
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:58,977
The Manor is surrounded by a
number of powerful magical barriers,

286
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:01,640
but they should be child's play for you.

287
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:05,654
Are you sure about this?

288
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,851
I was under the impression that
you were allies with Tokiomi Tohsaka.

289
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:11,857
Don't you worry about that.

290
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,300
Even if it means you have to engage
Archer in battle, there's no need to fear.

291
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:23,604
No need to fear Archer, one of the three
great Knight classes of the Grail Wars?

292
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:28,127
I leave the rest to you.

293
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:32,603
Eliminate Tokiomi Tohsaka at once.

294
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:35,198
This will be easy.

295
00:22:41,224 --> 00:22:47,012
You are nothing but a slimy worm. Who
gave you permission to look up at me?

296
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:54,559
No need... to fear that, he says?

297
00:23:05,414 --> 00:23:07,866
You are not worthy to gaze upon me.

298
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:14,222
A filthy worm like you should face the
ground, crawl on your stomach, and die.

299
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:52,057
At last, it's time for the fourth Holy Grail War to begin.

300
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:53,930
It's unspeakably ugly.

301
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:55,845
The item I left you, where is it?

302
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,336
This will be fun!

303
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,500
Welcome!

304
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,673
Grant me victory in this fight!

305
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:02,372
I will, without fail.
