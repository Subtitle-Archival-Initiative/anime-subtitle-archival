1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,477
Irisviel.

2
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:39,894
Are you all right?

3
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:42,548
They waited for Kiritsugu to leave

4
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,961
before launching a frontal assault.

5
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:49,627
That sudden lightning and that
unscrupulous appearance of his.

6
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:51,110
The enemy.

7
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,481
His likely Rider.

8
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:29,189
Whoa!

9
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:35,916
Huh?

10
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:37,882
Hello, Saber.

11
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,207
Rider?

12
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:44,889
I came because I wanted to see your castle.

13
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:49,552
It's kind of gloomy here, don't you think, hmm?

14
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,086
And what's with the tasteless armor?

15
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:54,408
Are you going out to fight someone right now?

16
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,667
Why aren't you wearing your
fashionable clothes like I am tonight?

17
00:02:59,064 --> 00:02:59,611
Rider.

18
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:01,331
What are you doing here?

19
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:03,717
You mean you can't tell?

20
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,102
I've come to drink, what else does
it look like I've come here to do?

21
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:12,955
So stop standing there like
statue and show me around this place.

22
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,949
Surely you have a garden here suitable for a banquet.

23
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,955
Honestly, this castle is far too dusty to be in.

24
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:41,875
The Grail is said to be fated for the
hands of the one most worthy to possess it.

25
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,365
And the epic battle taking place here in Fuyuki

26
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:48,098
will determine exactly who that person is.

27
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:53,423
And if it's simply a means to decide that
fact, there's hardly a need for bloodshed.

28
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:58,361
After all, if the heroic
spirits can agree on our rankings,

29
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,447
then the matter can simply settle itself.

30
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:11,576
Oh.

31
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,679
Then I assume you wish to compare
your rank against my own, Rider.

32
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:20,093
Indeed I do.

33
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,575
As one who also claims the title of
king, you can not refuse this opportunity.

34
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:28,526
You might consider this a Grail
dialog, rather than a Grail War.

35
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:32,746
And the matter of who among us who
is most suited to claim the Holy Grail

36
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:38,720
will become clear to us as we drink our fill and converse.

37
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:44,994
I believe that is quite enough nonsense.

38
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:47,564
You mongrels.

39
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,490
Archer, what are you doing here?

40
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:53,247
Ah, yes, well,

41
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:57,933
I saw him in town so I thought I might
as well invite him to our little gathering.

42
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:01,015
You're a little late don't you think, goldie,

43
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,752
though it stands to reason since
you traveled by foot unlike myself.

44
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:09,770
You actually chose to hold a banquet
of kings in a depressing place like this?

45
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:13,447
How will you recompense me for
the rudeness of calling me here?

46
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:16,240
Oh, why don't you just relax yourself.

47
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:18,848
Here, start with a little drink.

48
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:29,929
What is this disgusting swill?

49
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:34,214
You really thought we could discern a
hierarchy of heroic spirits with this?

50
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,776
You don't like it?

51
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:40,195
This cask was among the very best I could
find at the city marketplace this afternoon.

52
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,129
You are pitifully ignorant of true drink.

53
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,165
Of course you believe that.

54
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:47,151
Stupid mongrel.

55
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,263
Ah!

56
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:59,369
Now behold and acknowledge your folly.

57
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,730
This is the beverage of a true king.

58
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,616
A fine treasure, indeed.

59
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,855
Aaahhh.

60
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:18,961
Ah, magnificent.

61
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:25,377
My treasury houses only the very
finest of drinks and the finest of swords.

62
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:33,430
This alone should indicate which
among us is the greatest of kings.

63
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:39,877
Archer, your finest drink is indeed
worthy of the finest vessel in all of history.

64
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,255
But the Holy Grail is not a drinking cup.

65
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:45,802
First, we must hear what wish
you would have the Grail grant

66
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:47,002
should you win it.

67
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:50,056
The wish is what gives the Grail its purpose.

68
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:52,145
You are not ruler here, mongrel.

69
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:55,619
Already you wantonly disregard the time honored rules

70
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:57,778
which dictate we fight for the Grail.

71
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,133
Hmm?

72
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:03,130
Besides all that, the Grail already belongs to me.

73
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:08,140
All of this world's treasures without
exception trace their origin to my treasure house.

74
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:09,402
They do, do they?

75
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:12,152
Then I assume that means you once held the Holy Grail,

76
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:14,158
you can identify it by sight.

77
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,353
No.

78
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:16,218
Huh?

79
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,460
Do not consider me as you would a lesser being.

80
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:22,505
The amount of wealth in my treasury
long ago surpassed my own knowledge.

81
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,766
But that the Holy Grail is a treasure
also means that it belongs to me.

82
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,839
And any who would take it for themselves

83
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:33,662
is not but a filthy scoundrel and a common thief.

84
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,032
Your words are no different than
Caster's senseless and insane rants.

85
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:42,044
It appears he isn't the only
Servant to have gone completely mad.

86
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,027
Come, let's not go that far.

87
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:51,192
However, I believe I now have a clue
as to what goldie's actual identity is.

88
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:57,755
So then, Archer, you suggested if we desire
the Grail we must first get your permission?

89
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:04,662
Indeed, however there is no reason whatsoever
for me to reward lowly mongrels of your ilk.

90
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:08,474
Wait a minute, you're going to be stingy?

91
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,530
Fool, my magnanimity is limited to
my vassals and to my loyal subjects.

92
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:18,069
Which means, Rider, if you were to swear fealty to me,

93
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,685
I could lend you a Grail or two,

94
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:22,895
whenever you felt the need for one.

95
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,947
Sorry, that is totally out of the question.

96
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,776
But tell me, Archer, surely you have no
special interest in the Holy Grail itself, do you?

97
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:35,642
Of course not, but I must render my judgment upon those

98
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,835
who would dare to steal treasure from me.

99
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:40,282
It's simply a matter of principle.

100
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,737
Hmm, I'm curious, Archer.

101
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:47,913
On what morals and reasoning are
these principles of yours based?

102
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:52,667
It is the law, my law which I
set down as the rightful king.

103
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:54,487
Perfect.

104
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:58,108
Living by one's own law is the epitome of kingship.

105
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:06,630
Nevertheless, I desire the Holy
Grail so badly I could almost taste it.

106
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:10,237
And it has always been my style to just take what I want.

107
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,857
After all, the Great Iskandar

108
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:15,976
is the King of Conquerors, is he not?

109
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:18,271
Right and wrong are irrelevant.

110
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,888
You break the law and I will punish you.

111
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:23,559
There is no place for discussion.

112
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:24,707
Hmm.

113
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,166
Which means that all we have left to us

114
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:30,630
is to meet on the field of combat.

115
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:37,003
So then, Archer, would you still like
us to help you finish this off tonight?

116
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,425
There'll be plenty of time to kill each other after.

117
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:46,139
Indeed, or do you dare sit there and cast aspersions
on the superior drink I did you the honor of providing?

118
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,787
No, of course not, I wouldn't dream
of letting this drink go to waste.

119
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,340
King of Conquerors.

120
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,020
Hmm?

121
00:09:56,508 --> 00:10:01,465
A moment ago you agreed that the Holy Grail's
rightful ownership lies with another and not yourself.

122
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:04,087
And yet you would just take it by force?

123
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:07,588
What makes the Grail so important to you?

124
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,399
Reincarnation.

125
00:10:20,732 --> 00:10:21,472
Huh?

126
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:22,574
What?

127
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,595
Wait a minute, wasn't your goal
supposed to be world conquest?

128
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:26,421
Ah!

129
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,782
Idiot, as if I would leave
the conquering to some mere cup.

130
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:36,086
Conquering the world is my dream to make true.

131
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,654
The wish I would ask of the Holy Grail

132
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,522
is the first step towards that goal.

133
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,783
Mongrel, you would dare challenge me for my treasure

134
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:47,810
over something so trivial?

135
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,871
Even in magic lends us form in this world,

136
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:53,470
ultimately we remain Servants.

137
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:58,435
I wish to live as flesh and blood

138
00:10:58,902 --> 00:11:01,796
within this world in which I find myself.

139
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:04,018
And with nothing but my body

140
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:06,113
I shall defy both heaven and Earth,

141
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,936
succeeding in that endeavor
is the true meaning of conquest.

142
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:11,649
Thus it begins.

143
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:15,505
Then proceeds onward and finally is finished.

144
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:20,300
Such is the path of my conquest.

145
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:23,703
Hmm, then the matter is settled.

146
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:27,324
I shall take great pleasure in killing you myself.

147
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:30,238
You don't have to remind me of the obvious.

148
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:36,677
I have every intention of plundering your abundant
storehouse until it's been laid bare, so get ready.

149
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,207
That is hardly fitting of how a true king should behave.

150
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:46,365
Oh, well then, let us hear
what you would ask of the Grail,

151
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:48,065
if you were to win it.

152
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:55,691
I wish for my homeland's salvation.

153
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:59,457
With the omnipotent wish granting device,

154
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:03,554
I shall avert Britain's fate of destruction.

155
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:11,378
They're having a drinking party of all things?

156
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:15,335
Shall I continue to leave Archer to his own devices?

157
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,572
Hmm, it can't be helped.

158
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:24,321
After all, when one is King of Kings, it simply wouldn't
do to turn one's back on an interesting invitation.

159
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:31,612
Incidentally, Kirei, how do you judge
the relative strengths of Rider and Archer?

160
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:37,092
Rider may very well possess a trump
card that surpasses the gordius wheel.

161
00:12:37,894 --> 00:12:40,340
I believe we should put this to the test.

162
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:44,668
Hmm, with Rider and his Master
drinking and their guard's down,

163
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:48,277
a better chance to attack them
will never again present itself.

164
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,764
The odds of victory don't matter to our overall plan.

165
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:54,067
Even if Assassin is defeated,

166
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,909
as long as he can gauge their relative strengths,

167
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:58,962
our objective will be accomplished.

168
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:01,057
We do have the option

169
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:04,100
of launching an attack right now, Kirei.

170
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,424
I have no objections.

171
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,293
I believe it will take roughly ten
minutes to summon all the Assassins.

172
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:14,286
Fine, give the order.

173
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:17,396
It is a large gamble, but even if it fails,

174
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:18,973
we stand to lose nothing.

175
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,097
Use a command seal to give Assassin the following order.

176
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:27,053
Be victorious no matter the cost, got it?

177
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:36,629
Hey, King of Knights, did you
just say that you would change fate?

178
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,356
Does that mean that you wish to change events long past?

179
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:44,896
Indeed, even if it is a wish that
a miracle alone can not fulfill.

180
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:47,811
If the Holy Grail is truly omnipotent,

181
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:49,261
then surely...

182
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,026
Um, Saber, just so I am clear on this,

183
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:01,654
it was back during your time that his
country you call Britain was conquered and fell?

184
00:14:02,104 --> 00:14:03,924
When it was under your rule?

185
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:07,112
Correct, that is why I can not allow it.

186
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,514
And that is why I regret it.

187
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:11,539
Why I want to alter that outcome,

188
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,137
for it was I and none other who was to blame.

189
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,961
Archer, what's so amusing?

190
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,785
You call yourself a king and are praised by all as such,

191
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,986
and yet you feel regret.

192
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:31,796
How can I not laugh at such nonsense?

193
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:36,110
Saber, surely you do not really mean

194
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:41,213
that you would erase the marks that
you yourself have left on history?

195
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,364
I do, and what of it?

196
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:44,690
Why do you laugh?

197
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:48,755
My beloved country to which I
devoted my whole life was destroyed.

198
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,039
Why is my sadness about that strange?

199
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:52,894
Did you hear that drivel, Rider?

200
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:56,508
Did you hear what this little girl
who calls herself King of Knights said?

201
00:14:56,628 --> 00:15:00,005
Her beloved country to which she devoted her whole life.

202
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:02,074
Why is that humorous to you?

203
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:05,304
For their country's prosperity,

204
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:08,603
a true king should be willing to make any sacrifice.

205
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:10,115
You are wrong.

206
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:13,386
The king does not devote himself.

207
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:15,105
It is the nation and the people

208
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,451
who must devote themselves to the king.

209
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,286
You have reversed the concept.

210
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:20,419
I what?

211
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:23,023
Those are the words of a brutal tyrant.

212
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:23,965
Just so.

213
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:27,564
We are heroes precisely because we are tyrants.

214
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:33,786
However, Saber, if a king regrets his rule or
regrets the manner in which his rule came to an end,

215
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:37,923
that king is nothing but a fool,
worse than the tyrant you disdain.

216
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,686
Iskandar, your reign ended with all your heirs slain

217
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:45,016
and your great empire broken up by civil war.

218
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,155
Do you mean to say you have no regrets about that end?

219
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,139
None at all.

220
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:58,036
Not if it came to pass by my own decisions and by
the considerable sacrifices of my many retainers.

221
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:00,128
Its destruction was inevitable.

222
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,177
I shall mourn it and shed tears over it,

223
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,438
but I shall never regret it.

224
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:07,011
But you...

225
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:09,017
Let alone undo it all!

226
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:14,824
Such an act would be an insufferable insult to
all those who fought and bled and died alongside me.

227
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,799
It is only a warrior who can find glory in destruction,

228
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:20,596
worthless is a king who fails to protect the weak.

229
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:23,731
A just rule guided by just laws,

230
00:16:24,058 --> 00:16:26,141
those are the true duties of a king.

231
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,858
So you, the king of your realm,

232
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:31,755
are a slave to what is right?

233
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:33,030
I am.

234
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:35,940
Kings are martyrs to their ideals.

235
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:39,706
That is not the way a person should live.

236
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,651
If I rule a nation as king,

237
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:44,993
I can not expect to live as a person.

238
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:50,367
King of Conquerors, you seek the
Grail merely for your own benefit.

239
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,997
And as such, you could never understand that.

240
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:58,391
You, who became a ruler only
to satisfy your endless greed.

241
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:01,040
A king without greed is even worse than a figurehead!

242
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:06,560
Saber, you said you would martyr yourself for your ideals.

243
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:11,078
In life you must have been something
akin to the purest of all the saints.

244
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,689
A proud and noble figure at the very least.

245
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:20,442
But who can truly admire the rough and
thorny path that a martyr must follow in life?

246
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,358
Who actually dreams of such an ending?

247
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,018
A king must be greedier than any other.

248
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:32,792
He must laugh more loudly and rage for much longer

249
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:36,482
and embody the very extreme of all things good and evil.

250
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:40,098
That is why his retainers envy his very existence.

251
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:41,765
And adore him as well.

252
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:44,309
And why the flames of aspiration

253
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:46,845
to be just as the king is

254
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,443
can burn within his people.

255
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,203
Proud king of chivalry,

256
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:59,268
the righteousness and ideals you embraced in life

257
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:01,655
may have indeed saved your nation

258
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,579
and her people once.

259
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:10,623
However, surely you must know what
became of those who were saved by you.

260
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,148
But then were left to fend for themselves.

261
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:15,587
What are you saying?

262
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:28,501
You may indeed have saved them,

263
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:30,749
but you never led them.

264
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,527
You never showed them all what a king should really be.

265
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:38,392
You abandoned your men when they lost their way.

266
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:41,124
Then alone and untroubled by that fact,

267
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,369
you went on to follow your own
pretty little ideals to the end.

268
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,970
Thus, you are no true king.

269
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:56,478
You spent your life enraptured by a false
idol of a humble king who always serves others.

270
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:58,773
You're just a little girl.

271
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:03,774
I...

272
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,801
I...

273
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:21,628
What are you laughing at, Archer?

274
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:22,981
Oh, nothing.

275
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:26,981
I simply felt that your anguished
face was a rather lovely sight.

276
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:31,815
It was the face of the virgins who
showered me with flower pedals in my bed.

277
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,362
A woman after my own heart.

278
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,528
Bastard!

279
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,094
Huh?

280
00:19:41,294 --> 00:19:42,108
Hmm.

281
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:43,619
Ah.

282
00:19:46,774 --> 00:19:47,541
Ahhh.

283
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:53,244
Assassin.

284
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:04,763
So is this all your doing, goldie?

285
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:08,645
Tokiomi, what a shameful cur.

286
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,204
This isn't fair. Why are there
so many Assassins surrounding us?

287
00:20:13,604 --> 00:20:16,074
We are one divided into many.

288
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:18,435
An army and also one.

289
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:21,122
A Servant with many shadows.

290
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,103
And one.

291
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:30,007
A Servant with separate bodies for
each of his multiple personalities?

292
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,573
Rider, um, I...

293
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:35,881
Oh, calm yourself.

294
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:38,078
Nothing to worry about, boy.

295
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,922
Even those rude enough to interrupt our banquet

296
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:43,903
may yet show us which is the greatest king.

297
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:48,604
So I suppose you'll invite them all to our
little banquet as well, King of Conquerors?

298
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:53,223
But of course, a king's words are
meant for all to hear and absorb.

299
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,679
If they have come here to listen, it
matters not if they are friend or foe.

300
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:02,267
Now then, don't hold back.

301
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:05,865
Any who would speak with us, come forth and take a cup.

302
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:09,223
This drink is as your blood.

303
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:18,248
Very well.

304
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:22,165
As I said, this drink is as your blood.

305
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:25,751
If you insist on spilling it here tonight,

306
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:27,379
then so be it.

307
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:46,021
Saber, Archer, here is our banquet's final question.

308
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:49,510
It is, does a king always stand alone?

309
00:21:50,688 --> 00:21:55,198
The king must indeed be alone, always.

310
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:58,630
No, no, you obviously don't understand.

311
00:21:59,072 --> 00:22:01,807
I suppose I'll just have to show you both right now

312
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:06,224
exactly what a real king is all about
when faced with an adversary like this one.

313
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,397
Huh?

314
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,279
Huh?

315
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,380
A reality marble?

316
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:34,002
That's impossible.

317
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:37,608
A mental image materialized into the real world.

318
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:43,337
My glorious armies once rode across these sands.

319
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:49,193
A place that all the heroes who stood with
me through joy and sorrow will never forget.

320
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:58,983
I can make this world as real as real can ever be.

321
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:02,318
Because it still exists deep within our hearts.

322
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:07,725
Behold my endless armies.

323
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:14,014
Their bodies utterly destroyed and their souls
offered to the current world as heroic spirits of old.

324
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:18,655
And still, these legendary
heroes pledge their loyalty to me.

325
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:22,243
My bond with them is my greatest treasure.

326
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:24,013
My path to kingship.

327
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:26,766
The ultimate noble phantasm that I possess!

328
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,792
I order in Haitari.

329
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:38,934
Wait a minute, so each of these is a Servant?

330
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:42,304
It has been a long time, partner.

331
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:46,640
Hear me!

332
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:51,419
A king must live a grand life and
embody his people's image of admiration.

333
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,220
Aye, aye, aye.

334
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:01,820
He who is worthy of all heroes envy and
he who leads their way, that is a king!

335
00:24:02,413 --> 00:24:05,102
Therefore, the king is not alone,

336
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:11,024
for his will equals that of all who would
follow him to his ultimate glory combined!

337
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:14,553
Aye, aye, aye!

338
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,051
Now then, shall we begin our battle, Assassin?

339
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:27,132
As you can see, what we have created is a vast plane
and with our superior numbers, we hold the advantage.

340
00:24:28,115 --> 00:24:30,096
Annihilate them!

341
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:19,427
Aaarggh!

342
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:43,704
That ending wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped for.

343
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,931
We have said all there is to say.

344
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:51,250
I suppose that will do for today.

345
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,836
Wait, Rider, I have not finished.

346
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,071
You may keep silent.

347
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,317
Tonight was for a conversation amongst kings.

348
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,897
But I no longer recognize you as a king, Saber.

349
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:14,074
Little girl, you must wake from
your sad dream and see the truth.

350
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:20,075
If you don't, you'll someday lose even that
modicum of pride you retain as a heroic spirit.

351
00:26:20,568 --> 00:26:25,859
The dream of a king you spoke of earlier is a
curse and a burden which blinds and cripples you.

352
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,853
A what?

353
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,184
Pay that base mongrel no heed, Saber.

354
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:43,542
You are correct, follow the path you believe in.

355
00:26:44,892 --> 00:26:47,570
Your agonizing pain and terrible sorrow

356
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:51,609
as you bear a burden of kingship
that is too heavy a weight for any

357
00:26:52,324 --> 00:26:55,901
is quite a splendid and marvelous thing to look upon.

358
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:59,344
Keep at it, oh great King of Knights.

359
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:04,436
It is possible you may prove worthy
of still more of my magnificent love.

360
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,059
Saber.

361
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:17,428
I remember now.

362
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:21,356
There was once a knight who left Camelot

363
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,863
claiming the king didn't understand how others felt.

364
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:33,963
Well, perhaps that... that sentiment was shared by
all of the knights who sat with me at the round table.

365
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:19,328
This will begin the second stage.

366
00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:21,814
I'm not in any way a normal human being.

367
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,469
But Irisviel, that simply can not be all there is to it.

368
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:26,653
Do it all exactly as you desire.

369
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,633
Your path is now clear, Kirei.

370
00:29:28,658 --> 00:29:31,287
But that is the soul of a Godless sinner!
