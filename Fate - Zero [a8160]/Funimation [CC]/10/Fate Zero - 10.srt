1
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,158
Ah!

2
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,064
What?

3
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,577
Ah!

4
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,915
Rin.

5
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:57,693
Hey!

6
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:02,308
You losers shouldn't gang up on
someone and bully them like that!

7
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:05,291
You guys suck, you really suck!

8
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:08,564
What's your problem, Tohsaka?
There's nothing here that concerns you.

9
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,583
Yeah, in that case, why don't you do the same to me?

10
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:15,012
And then it will concern me.

11
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:20,263
Come on, this is getting lame.

12
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:24,639
Here.

13
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,574
You used too much mana all at once.

14
00:03:33,697 --> 00:03:35,383
Maintain a calm mind.

15
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:40,833
In order to control magic, you must first
achieve complete control of your thoughts.

16
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:51,113
Lose control and the mana will
suddenly rebound back to your body.

17
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:58,008
Too much power or power in the wrong form
will endanger not only you, but those around you.

18
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,982
Strive to consistently maintain the proper flow.

19
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:04,519
That is the Tohsaka family motto.

20
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:07,985
It means always remaining reserved

21
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:09,525
and elegant.

22
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:16,696
You shouldn't let them get way
with it when they try that stuff.

23
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,528
If they're in the wrong, you just have
to get mad and do something about it.

24
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:24,239
You're amazing, Rin, the way you
always speak your mind like that.

25
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:25,737
I'm not amazing at all.

26
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:28,546
I think it's normal. I mean, it's only natural.

27
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,078
That's right, it's only natural.

28
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,443
Hold out your hand.

29
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:46,573
Oh.

30
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:49,302
Father, oh please teach me more.

31
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,850
How do I make something like this?

32
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:56,100
Well, my dear, that might be a
bit difficult for you right now.

33
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:00,738
But if you work hard every day,

34
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:02,729
you'll be able to make it eventually.

35
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:08,336
After all, Rin, you're a daughter of the Tohsaka family.

36
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:20,893
Hey, Rin, could you please show me how to do this part?

37
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,576
Of course, which part?

38
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,116
Yeah, me too.

39
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:25,352
Me too.

40
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:28,771
Oh, this was on page 23 of the textbook.

41
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:32,012
You see, you just did the math wrong here.

42
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:34,911
For this problem, it's just like this example, see?

43
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:45,405
Kotone, have a seat, I'll help everyone in turn.

44
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:46,994
Okay.

45
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:08,352
Do I really have to go and live with the Zenjo family?

46
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:13,944
Once the Holy Grail War begins, it
will no longer be safe for you in Fuyuki.

47
00:06:15,385 --> 00:06:19,588
But I... but I want to do something
to help you with the Grail War, Father.

48
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:22,851
Rin, you mustn't cause trouble for your father.

49
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:25,657
Do you think that we're in the way?

50
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:27,056
Not at all.

51
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:31,688
Please try to understand, I need
to make preparations for the battle.

52
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:36,892
Those preparations include doing
what's necessary to ensure your safety.

53
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:41,449
And for me to do that, you simply can't stay in Fuyuki.

54
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,219
But I'm certain there's something I can do to help!

55
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:56,636
That's right, I just haven't learned how to yet.

56
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,261
So, all I need to do is study on my own.

57
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:07,163
I don't understand any of this.

58
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,187
What is this?

59
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:10,494
Tease!

60
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,232
Oh.

61
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,676
I have to close it.

62
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:35,473
It won't move.

63
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:39,932
Rin!

64
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,583
Are you all right?

65
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:54,036
It's still too soon for you to read this book.

66
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:58,908
Some things in this world contain their own mana.

67
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:13,259
This is called a mana compass. Normally, it doesn't
point to anything except for mana traces in the area.

68
00:08:14,186 --> 00:08:16,996
Rin, try generating mana in this.

69
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:18,143
Okay.

70
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:24,406
Ah.

71
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:25,963
You see?

72
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,468
And with that book.

73
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:35,955
Anything that provokes a reaction like that
is beyond your ability, so be very careful.

74
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:37,188
Ah.

75
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:40,950
I'll give this to you as an early birthday present.

76
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:44,579
Oh, thank you so much, Father.

77
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:49,965
Once the Holy Grail War is all over,
you and I will try some real jewel magic.

78
00:08:53,124 --> 00:08:55,652
And then strange things began to happen.

79
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:08,022
They said we have study hall again.

80
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:13,829
There was another kidnapping on the news this morning.

81
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,633
...the sudden disappearance of children

82
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:17,124
has police investigators baffled.

83
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,584
The teachers have been in a meeting all day.

84
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:21,455
They said we won't have fifth period today.

85
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,254
All right!

86
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:24,176
But they said we should stay home.

87
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:24,621
Why?

88
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:26,120
Another kidnapping.

89
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:28,709
They say only children have been kidnapped.

90
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:30,052
Hey, did you hear?

91
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:30,742
Uh.

92
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:38,417
Apparently there's no body inside
the coffin, it was in such bad shape.

93
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,436
It definitely happened in Fuyuki, right?

94
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,840
My name is Tohsaka and I'm in Kotone's class...

95
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:54,522
The person you are calling is not home.

96
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:56,480
Please leave your message after the beep.

97
00:09:56,677 --> 00:09:57,539
Thank you.

98
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,173
Please be safe.

99
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:18,365
Kotone.

100
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:31,946
This is Fuyuki at night.

101
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,157
It's different than during the day.

102
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,793
Ooh, it's really cold and creepy.

103
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:47,925
What is this?

104
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,780
I've never seen it do this.

105
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,167
Does this mean there are traces of magic all around here?

106
00:10:58,276 --> 00:10:59,968
I've got to find Kotone.

107
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:42,496
Huh?

108
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:45,419
Someone out with their kid this late?

109
00:11:48,194 --> 00:11:49,614
What was that flash?

110
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:16,397
Oh, no.

111
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,944
That was close.

112
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:30,253
If I'm spotted, they'll take me home.

113
00:12:36,946 --> 00:12:39,539
Come on, you've got to walk, kid.

114
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:49,656
Two of them?

115
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:56,702
He's gathered more kids.

116
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,494
But why?

117
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:02,508
Wait, why am I hiding?

118
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:06,620
I can't accomplish anything this way.

119
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,894
Looks like no one's here.

120
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,613
Hey, hey you?

121
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:47,265
Kotone, Kotone, Kotone!

122
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:50,490
Something's been done to her.

123
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:51,891
What do I do?

124
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:53,372
Think, Rin.

125
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:03,268
Well now, are you lost little girl?

126
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:06,295
No, um I...

127
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:07,782
Perfect timing.

128
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:12,340
We were just about to get the party started.

129
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:15,329
But we still don't have enough guests.

130
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:17,114
Want to help?

131
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:18,743
It'll be fun.

132
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:28,262
When it comes to parties, the
more the merrier I always say.

133
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:31,269
No!

134
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:34,191
What, what just happened?

135
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:36,184
Don't run from me.

136
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:45,757
Is he controlling them with that bracelet?

137
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:58,127
Ow!

138
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:00,027
I've got it.

139
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:12,163
Well, well, you're gonna help me after all?

140
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:21,462
Huh?

141
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,884
What is that?

142
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,686
You use too much mana all at once.

143
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:46,316
I can destroy that!

144
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:50,357
What?

145
00:16:58,277 --> 00:16:59,154
Kotone!

146
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:02,541
Rin?

147
00:17:03,132 --> 00:17:04,460
What's going on?

148
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:09,207
This is not the time to cry.

149
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:10,207
Run!

150
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,164
Hey, wait!

151
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:18,221
Oh, man.

152
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:20,987
I hope the big guy won't be too pissed.

153
00:17:27,723 --> 00:17:28,838
Where's Rin?

154
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:35,058
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

155
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:36,782
Good, it's done.

156
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:39,756
I did it, Father.

157
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:43,911
What?

158
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:48,658
Ah!

159
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:58,711
Anything that provokes a reaction like that
is beyond your ability, so be very careful.

160
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:01,827
Ah.

161
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:30,392
Rin, I just can't believe she went to Fuyuki.

162
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:38,614
Rin!

163
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:42,205
Rin.

164
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,642
Rin is fine.

165
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:45,496
She's just asleep.

166
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,847
Kariya.

167
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:55,314
What's happening here?

168
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:57,645
What are you doing here?

169
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,024
Your face.

170
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:06,778
Behold the family magic of the Matous.

171
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,128
You offer your flesh and your life is slowly devoured.

172
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:12,832
That is the magic's price.

173
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:16,064
But Sakura will be fine.

174
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:19,130
I'll save her before this happens to her.

175
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:22,489
Zouken's only desire is the grail.

176
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,483
He gave me his promise that he'll release Sakura

177
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:28,149
as soon as I win it for him.

178
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:30,498
If you win the grail?

179
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,388
Yeah, so don't worry.

180
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:34,352
My servant is the strongest.

181
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:36,247
It won't lose to anyone.

182
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:42,156
Considering what she's been through, hope would
be nothing but cruel torture to Sakura right now.

183
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,340
So, pray for her since she can't.

184
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:49,058
Pray for my victory, for Sakura's future.

185
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:54,444
Kariya, wait.

186
00:19:56,636 --> 00:19:59,653
Someday I'm sure we'll all play in this park,

187
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,542
just like we used to back in better days.

188
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:05,564
And Rin and Sakura will be sisters again.

189
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:10,401
So, Aoi, you don't need to cry anymore.

190
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:18,825
Kariya, are you going to die and kill Tokiomi too?

191
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:24,319
Mother?

192
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:28,121
Rin, I was so worried about you.

193
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:31,217
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

194
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,705
I'm so sorry.

195
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:34,605
I'm so sorry.

196
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:43,767
Master Kirei, are you certain that you wish to
allow Tokiomi Tohsaka's wife and daughter to go free?

197
00:20:44,513 --> 00:20:45,533
It's fine.

198
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,869
You are to continue monitoring Berserker's master.

199
00:20:49,804 --> 00:20:50,804
Understood.

200
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:11,531
It wasn't much, but I did manage to do something.

201
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:15,722
I guess I'm not a full‐fledged mage yet.

202
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:18,188
I passed out half way through.

203
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:21,713
That means I need to work harder.

204
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:24,674
But that's just for now.

205
00:21:25,757 --> 00:21:27,994
I have plenty of time to train more.

206
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:32,772
And someday, I'll take my place as a Tohsaka mage.

207
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:38,665
I'll have to practice really hard and obey my
father so that I'll be ready when that day comes.

208
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,625
And when the time does come,

209
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:46,110
I'll do it to the best of my
ability, as elegantly as I can.

210
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:29,271
A king without greed is even worse than a figure head!

211
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:31,811
Worthless is a king who fails to protect the weak.

212
00:23:31,836 --> 00:23:33,224
We stand to lose nothing.

213
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:34,980
A reality marble?

214
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:37,820
I shall take great pleasure in killing you myself.

215
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:39,800
Wasn't your goal supposed to be world conquest?

216
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:40,267
Argh!
