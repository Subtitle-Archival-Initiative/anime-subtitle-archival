1
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:07,162
Well, everything went smoothly.

2
00:00:08,564 --> 00:00:14,699
These games of yours are tiresome and
tedious and squander my precious time, Tokiomi.

3
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:17,565
I am very grateful, Your Highness.

4
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:24,279
King of all Kings, Gilgamesh.

5
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:28,950
Your deeds tonight will establish your prowess as king

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,943
and they will reveal which of
our foes we must hunt and eliminate.

7
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:37,975
I ask only that you stay your
hand for just a little while longer.

8
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:40,917
Very well.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,713
For the time being, I shall amuse
myself with simple reconnaissance.

10
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:50,030
This age truly fascinates me.

11
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:53,382
I take that to mean the modern world is to your liking?

12
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:59,334
It's unspeakably ugly, but that is fine in its own way.

13
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:05,374
The important thing is whether any of the
treasures available here are truly worthy of me.

14
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:11,213
Of course, if I find there is nothing
in this world that deserves my adoration,

15
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:13,870
you will pay dearly for summoning me.

16
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:17,078
Of that, you can be certain, Tokiomi.

17
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:23,304
Worry not; the Holy Grail is surely an
item fit to please the King of Heroes.

18
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:26,462
That will be for me to ultimately determine and me alone.

19
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:31,042
No matter, I'll play along with
your little schemes for the moment.

20
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:34,512
Everything of value in this world belongs to me,

21
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:39,280
so I can assure you, no matter how
precious this grail of yours may be,

22
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:43,581
I will never let a lowly mongrel
even touch it without my consent.

23
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:47,011
Tokiomi, I'll leave the details to you.

24
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:59,051
My, my, honestly,

25
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:06,241
I'm amazed Gilgamesh materialized within the archer
class considering their reputation for solo combat skills.

26
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:11,762
Well, I can let Kirei handle things from here.

27
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:16,789
For now, everything is proceeding according to plan.

28
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:54,702
Assassin was killed?

29
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:58,086
Hey, Rider, this is big news!

30
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:00,033
One of the seven is already out!

31
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:04,963
Hey.

32
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,219
Come on, don't you get it?

33
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:15,037
Assassin was killed!

34
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:16,336
Mm‐hmm.

35
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:19,587
Rider, the Holy Grail War has started!

36
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:25,640
I've been out gathering information day after
day after day after day, every single damn day!

37
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,820
You sit around eating cookies watching stuff on the VCR!

38
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:31,578
You're worse than a familiar, worse than a rat!

39
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:35,159
And I told you that I always want you
to take spirit form when I don't need you.

40
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:38,630
I'm giving you all the manna while you're
doing nothing but eating and watching!

41
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:39,989
Quit your whining.

42
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:42,802
Nobody cares if Assassin is dead or alive.

43
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,383
The only thing he's good at is
skulking around in the shadows.

44
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,395
He could never pose a threat to me.

45
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:52,391
Anyway, boy, here, this is what matters!

46
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:55,737
This, the big black thing they call a B‐2!

47
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:57,218
It's wonderful!

48
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:59,182
I'm thinking about buying 10 or so.

49
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:00,458
What do you think?

50
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:05,875
For that much money, it'd be faster
to just buy the whole country outright.

51
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:08,396
Oh, I see.

52
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,589
So, the question is where to procure the money.

53
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:18,114
Were there some major city nearby, such as Persepolis,
we could simply plunder it and get what we need.

54
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:23,912
For the moment, I think that the biggest
obstacle for us will be this Clinton guy.

55
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,303
He will prove a more formidable opponent than Darius III.

56
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:33,742
Well, regardless of all that, I think it's a pretty
good thing that Assassin was eliminated right off the bat.

57
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:37,678
I mean, aren't you the type who
prefers to face his enemy head‐on?

58
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:44,149
So, it's good news for us that the guy who uses sneak
attacks and devious tricks to fight his battles is out.

59
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,440
We could get some good use
from these Tomahawk things, too.

60
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,702
Saber, Lancer, Archer, the three great knight classes,

61
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,486
not to mention the Berserker,
whose sole skill is to break things,

62
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:56,906
are gonna be toast when you
use that noble phantasm of yours.

63
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:58,812
That just leaves Caster to worry about.

64
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:01,285
If we could only find out what
his true identity is, we could...

65
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:03,244
How was Assassin taken down?

66
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:04,124
Huh?

67
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:05,278
Tell me.

68
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:07,372
Who was it that defeated him?

69
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:09,594
You saw it, right?

70
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:12,873
I, uh, I think it was Tohsaka's servant.

71
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:14,049
It was brutal:

72
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:19,216
his brilliant appearance, his quick attacks,
everything was golden, bright, and flashy.

73
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:21,661
It all happened so fast, I couldn't tell what...

74
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:22,748
You fool!

75
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:29,558
If I am to fight someone, it will be the victor
of all the other battles between the servants.

76
00:06:29,676 --> 00:06:32,309
Why weren't you paying attention to how he won?

77
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:34,582
Well, it matters not.

78
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,794
Did anything else strike you about the
flashy gold man or the way he fought the battle?

79
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:44,921
But... but it was the middle of the
night and it was all over in a second.

80
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:50,450
Hey, Rider, normally a servant
only has one noble phantasm, right?

81
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,541
Yes, of course, that's the rule.

82
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:57,343
But how many isn't the correct way
to conceptualize a noble phantasm.

83
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:03,685
As I'm sure you already know, a noble phantasm is the
physical manifestation of a hero's most indelible legend

84
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,086
or most famous tale.

85
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:10,240
Sometimes, it may be a specific
ability or a special method of attack.

86
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:15,928
So, then, is there a noble phantasm that
consists of throwing dozens of swords at an opponent?

87
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:19,009
A sword that makes copies of itself, really?

88
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:21,670
Huh, yes, it's possible.

89
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,079
That could still qualify as a single noble phantasm.

90
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:29,811
But, wait, those swords weren't copies.

91
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,432
Each one of them had a completely different shape.

92
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:38,974
Ah, forget it, we'll just have to discover each
of our enemies' identities as we encounter them.

93
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:45,938
Do you really think that would be wise?

94
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:48,744
Yes, actually it'll be more fun!

95
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,752
Food, sex, sleep, and war!

96
00:07:52,245 --> 00:07:55,925
Whatever you do, you should
always enjoy it to the fullest;

97
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,838
that is the secret of life.

98
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:05,542
All right now, let's go see if we can find
ourselves some invigorating entertainment outside.

99
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:07,008
We ride forth, boy!

100
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:07,976
Prepare yourself!

101
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:10,862
Uh, we ride forth? To where?

102
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:12,149
Well, to somewhere.

103
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:13,508
We can go anywhere!

104
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:14,942
Oh, come on, now!

105
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:18,667
Let's face it, you can't have been
the only one who was watching Tohsaka,

106
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,448
which means that news of
Assassin's death is making the rounds.

107
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:26,202
The others are probably going
to spring into action all at once,

108
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:31,205
but we shall crush each of them as we come across them.

109
00:08:31,535 --> 00:08:33,098
Go find and crush them all?

110
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:34,911
It won't be that easy.

111
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:36,537
I am Rider

112
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,536
and my speed far exceeds that of any
other servant I will face in this war.

113
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:49,067
Wait, wait, wait, not here!
You'll blow up the whole house!

114
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:52,267
My servant has been lost.

115
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:55,195
I have forfeited my rights as a master

116
00:08:55,356 --> 00:08:57,795
and cannot continue the Holy Grail War.

117
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:03,776
In accordance with the treaty, I, Kirei
Kotomine, ask that the church grant me sanctuary.

118
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:05,598
Request granted.

119
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:08,453
In my role as overseer of this war,

120
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:11,809
I, Risei Kotomine, guarantee your safety here.

121
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:13,868
Enter in peace.

122
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:19,071
Father, isn't this church being watched?

123
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:23,789
No, this holy place has been declared a neutral sanctuary.

124
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:28,514
The Holy Church will censure any
master who dares defy the decree.

125
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,544
Then, you're sure it's safe here?

126
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:32,958
Mmm.

127
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:36,982
But still, you should keep watch just in case.

128
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:39,948
Post a guard here at all times just to be sure.

129
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:42,791
Yes, understood.

130
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:46,651
Tell me, who was observing the battle?

131
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,693
Before the battle, I detected the presence
of familiars from four separate masters.

132
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:56,240
Two days ago, I was able to confirm the
summoning of the final servant, Caster.

133
00:09:56,524 --> 00:10:01,612
All of the Holy Grail War servants should have
now arrived and the fighting will begin shortly.

134
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:04,538
One unaccounted for.

135
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:09,588
I had hoped that all the masters would be
watching and taking note of the encounter.

136
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:16,963
At this point in the war, observing the three families'
estates would be a master's obvious course of action.

137
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:21,453
That's right, and if they can't even think to do that,

138
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:26,654
it would never even begin to occur to them
to worry about the existence of us assassins.

139
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:34,156
We spirits of the shadows shall sneak up behind
those masters who believe Assassin to be dead.

140
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:36,055
We shall sneak up behind them,

141
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:40,909
and this time, we shall become
true shadows in the darkness.

142
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,211
The battle for the grail is now at hand.

143
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:48,754
At last, it's time for the fourth Holy Grail War to begin.

144
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:54,694
These tired old eyes of mine will
finally see a wondrous miracle be performed.

145
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:11,931
Oh, my!

146
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:14,251
So, this is where Kiritsugu was born?

147
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,652
Well, Saber, how did you enjoy
your journey through the sky?

148
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:21,121
It was really nothing to speak of.

149
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:24,452
It was far simpler than I had actually anticipated.

150
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:29,043
Yes, well, I suppose that flying must
be nothing special to a real hero, right?

151
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:30,848
No, that's not it.

152
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:36,324
Upon materialization, all servants
receive knowledge of the modern world.

153
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:40,957
If required, I could even pilot
this aircraft with relative ease.

154
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:42,215
You could?

155
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:43,821
Are you serious?

156
00:11:44,016 --> 00:11:48,109
My riding skill allows me to command any beast or vehicle,

157
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,080
with the only exception being phantasmal or divine beasts.

158
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:56,912
Once I put the saddle between my
legs and take the reins, I'm in control.

159
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:59,687
The saddle between your legs and take the reins?

160
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:01,617
What is it?

161
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:04,292
Did I say something amusing to you?

162
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,462
Uh‐uh.

163
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:11,563
Still, you must be the only servant who
has flown in an airplane in physical form.

164
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,529
I apologize for that.

165
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,034
If only I could take spirit form.

166
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,592
No, I didn't mean it like that, really.

167
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,352
I never get tired of watching you.

168
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:24,937
Irisviel, is there something odd about me?

169
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:27,283
No, no, not at all.

170
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:31,913
When you laugh like that, there seems
to be some hidden meaning behind it.

171
00:12:32,196 --> 00:12:33,083
What is it?

172
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:34,969
I want you to be frank with me.

173
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:39,565
It means that your being stuck in
physical form isn't without its merits.

174
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:43,681
It's given me many enjoyable
hours of choosing outfits for you.

175
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:49,478
Irisviel, is this manner of dress
truly common for women of this era?

176
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,355
I choose it for you to balance out my own outfit.

177
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:53,696
You don't care for it?

178
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:54,848
No, it is fine.

179
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:59,495
It is rather easy to move in, and
besides, I'm used to dressing as a man.

180
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,531
This place is so very alive!

181
00:13:06,598 --> 00:13:10,457
Kiritsugu was supposed to have
arrived here in Japan already, wasn't he?

182
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,965
That's right, 12 hours before us.

183
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,557
But, don't worry, he'll find us as
soon as he's certain the time is right.

184
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,595
For the moment, we'll just have to keep an eye
on things so that we can act when the time comes.

185
00:13:22,688 --> 00:13:26,900
We've come all this way, I'd like to
enjoy the city before the fighting starts.

186
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:28,287
That's dangerous.

187
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,622
We should first concentrate on securing a base
of operations and discuss plans with Kiritsugu.

188
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,569
Well, yes, I suppose you're right about that.

189
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:41,217
But it's such a waste; we've come
all this way to such an exciting place!

190
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:43,271
That, and...

191
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:47,095
it's my very first time travelling.

192
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:48,330
Oh?

193
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:53,642
This is the first time I've ever ventured out
into the world outside the confines of my home.

194
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,596
Are you telling me that you spent
your entire life inside that castle?

195
00:14:00,393 --> 00:14:04,388
You see, I was a puppet created
specifically for the Holy Grail War.

196
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,735
Of course, it isn't as though I'm wholly ignorant;

197
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:11,107
Kiritsugu brought me movies and videos and pictures,

198
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:15,478
and he's tried in every way to teach me
everything he could about the outside world.

199
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,900
But this is the first time that I've
actually been able to see it with my own eyes,

200
00:14:20,364 --> 00:14:25,120
and so, please, forgive me! I got overly excited.

201
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:30,255
Please stop the car.

202
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:40,036
Walking through the city will be a
brand new experience for me as well.

203
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:50,605
It is a knight's duty to serve as escort;

204
00:14:50,944 --> 00:14:52,667
I shall do my very best.

205
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,473
Come with me.

206
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,038
The equipment you requested arrived a little while ago.

207
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:24,692
Madam Irisviel and Saber have
just arrived here in Fuyuki as well.

208
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:29,885
All the other masters will likely assume
that she is Saber's master and act accordingly.

209
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:31,342
Understood.

210
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:34,706
There was an incident last night at the Tohsaka Estate.

211
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,447
I recorded this footage.

212
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:43,087
What's your analysis of this?

213
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:45,630
It seems too good to be true.

214
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:49,821
There seem to be insufficient
time between Assassin's infiltration

215
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:51,999
and the Tohsaka servants' attack.

216
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:57,448
Assassin has a skill that masks his presence,
making it improbable he was detected in advance.

217
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:01,309
It is my opinion that Tohsaka was expecting an intruder.

218
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:06,256
In a battle amongst servants, learning
their identities is quite critical.

219
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:10,930
Why would Tohsaka expose his servant like he did?

220
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:13,256
He must have had a very good reason.

221
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,136
I suppose he had to.

222
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,426
Tell me, what became of Assassin's master?

223
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:21,894
He took refuge in a church last night.

224
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:24,962
The overseer declared him to be under his protection.

225
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:28,884
Assassin's master is Kirei Kotomine.

226
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,616
Maiya, send a familiar to watch the Fuyuki church.

227
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,604
Are you certain of that?

228
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:38,733
Masters are forbidding to take
action inside the neutral zone.

229
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,913
That's been established around the church.

230
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,220
Place it just far enough away

231
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,080
that the priest won't be able to spot it.

232
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:48,854
Very well, understood.

233
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:08,398
The item I left you, where is it?

234
00:17:08,714 --> 00:17:09,538
Right here.

235
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,601
Approximately two seconds.

236
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:29,207
I'm surprised.

237
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:30,358
Indeed.

238
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:42,181
I was just thinking, Illya
weighs a lot less than that Walther.

239
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:46,607
She's... eight years old already.

240
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:56,988
Focus on the matter at hand, just empty your mind.

241
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:05,773
Think of nothing else except your plan.

242
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:22,151
It's wonderful!

243
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:25,252
Almost like a mirror that reflects the night sky.

244
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:43,756
It's fun to walk around a strange and wondrous
new town accompanied by a gallant gentleman.

245
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:47,028
Did I really make an acceptable gentleman escort?

246
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,510
You were absolutely perfect, Saber.

247
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:53,051
You really were the most wonderful
knight a girl could ever hope for.

248
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:55,897
You honor me, Your Highness.

249
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,346
Saber, do you like the sea?

250
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:06,143
I suppose; I don't really know.

251
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:09,345
In my country, and way back in my time,

252
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:13,698
the sea was a source of attacks
by barbarians from the mainland.

253
00:19:13,938 --> 00:19:17,510
I never felt any affection for it and often hated it.

254
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,254
I feel kind of bad.

255
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:22,929
You're a girl, just as I am,

256
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:28,934
but when you were King Arthur, you never had the
luxury of enjoying simple things like this, did you?

257
00:19:30,897 --> 00:19:32,625
So, what about your desires?

258
00:19:32,774 --> 00:19:37,462
Surely, you would have much preferred to have
Kiritsugu escort you around town today, right?

259
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:40,970
Of course I would, but he couldn't.

260
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:43,807
It would only cause him pain and suffering.

261
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:48,806
Does Kiritsugu not enjoy the time he spends with you?

262
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:52,998
When he's happy, for some reason,

263
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:55,284
it seems to cause him pain.

264
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:08,030
An enemy servant?

265
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:13,707
Yes, making its presence known
from the shadows, 100 meters ahead.

266
00:20:14,237 --> 00:20:17,296
It appears to be inviting us over to go and see it.

267
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:21,869
How thoughtful; it wishes to decide on a battlefield.

268
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:24,308
Shall we take it up on its invitation?

269
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,276
I'd like nothing better.

270
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,910
Come on, Rider, let's get down from here right now!

271
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:41,060
Take me down!

272
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:43,534
But why?

273
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:47,027
This is a nearly perfect vantage
point to survey the whole land.

274
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:48,490
I'm leaving!

275
00:20:48,563 --> 00:20:49,296
No, wait!

276
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:51,783
Take me back down, I can't handle this!

277
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:53,275
Oh, calm yourself.

278
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:56,117
Waiting is a large part of war.

279
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:59,970
I wanna go... I wanna go back to England.

280
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:02,820
I told you not to be in such a damn hurry.

281
00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:06,459
You see, things have finally begun to unfold out there.

282
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:11,234
This is going to be a lot of fun!

283
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:18,093
Welcome.

284
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:22,714
I have spent the entire day
searching the city for a worthy foe.

285
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:27,448
Everyone just slinks away, hiding in their little holes.

286
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:31,423
You, alone, have accepted my offer.

287
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:35,353
That pure energy surrounding you;

288
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:38,874
you are the servant called Saber, I presume?

289
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:43,524
Indeed, I am, and I presume that
you are the one that's called Lancer?

290
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:51,096
Being unable to honorably name myself to my
opponent in combat troubles me more than I can describe.

291
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,100
I harbor an enormous dislike of these rules.

292
00:22:11,524 --> 00:22:13,838
Saber, please... be careful.

293
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:17,570
I can use my healing magic to
act as combat support for you.

294
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,739
But, more than that, Saber...

295
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:21,632
Just leave Lancer to me.

296
00:22:22,143 --> 00:22:26,097
It troubles me that his master is in
hiding and has not yet shown himself.

297
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:28,334
Perhaps they plot something.

298
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,025
Watch yourself.

299
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:35,942
And, Irisviel, from this point
on, I entrust you to watch my back.

300
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,138
Very well, I will, Saber.

301
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,010
Grant me victory in this fight.

302
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,717
I will, without fail.

303
00:24:20,364 --> 00:24:24,183
Let's see what you can do, my adorable King of Knights.

304
00:24:24,277 --> 00:24:26,918
Tales of the Saber class' magic resistance were true.

305
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:28,272
This man is impressive.

306
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:30,202
That's enough fun for now, Lancer.

307
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:31,789
What's going on with Saber?

308
00:24:31,814 --> 00:24:34,193
I'll go, take me with you, dammit!
