&gt;&gt; UH, SEIJI, WAIT, PLEASE.

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:46.414
JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:04:46.414 --> 00:04:47.881

00:04:49.217 --> 00:04:50.283
IT THROWS YOU OFF GUARD.

00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:52.385
MAKES YOU RETHINK THINGS.

00:04:52.385 --> 00:04:54.121
THERE’S A GIRL SITTING IN THIS

00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:55.722
CLASSROOM WHO CAUGHT A GLIMPSE

00:04:55.722 --> 00:04:57.256
OF JUST SUCH A THING.

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.425
SHE EXPERIENCED IT TWO DAYS AGO,

00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:01.760
WHEN SHE SHOULD HAVE DIED.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.198
SHE WAS BORN IN A NORMAL HOME,

00:05:07.198 --> 00:05:09.266
THE KIND YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERE.

00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:11.335
IT WAS A TYPICAL LIFE, WITH NO

00:05:11.335 --> 00:05:16.372
REAL BUMPS OR BRUISES.

00:05:16.372 --> 00:05:18.174
IT ARRIVED IN HER MAILBOX AROUND

00:05:18.174 --> 00:05:19.142
THE TIME SHE STARTED JUNIOR

00:05:19.142 --> 00:05:20.709
HIGH.

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:21.677
IT CAME WITHOUT WARNING OR

00:05:21.677 --> 00:05:24.212
PROVOCATION.

00:05:29.784 --> 00:05:31.919
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IN THE ENVELOPE?

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.187
&gt;&gt; PHOTOS.

00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:34.120
I THINK MY DAD’S HAVING AN

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.221
AFFAIR.

00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:36.422
THE PICTURE SHOWED HIM WITH

00:05:36.422 --> 00:05:38.058
ANOTHER WOMAN.

00:05:38.058 --> 00:05:38.991
AND THERE WAS A LETTER THAT

00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:40.760
SAID, "ARE YOU GOING TO LET HIM

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.327
GET AWAY WITH THIS?"

00:05:42.327 --> 00:05:43.462
I THINK THEY WERE SENT BY

00:05:43.462 --> 00:05:44.997
SOMEONE WHO KNEW THE WOMAN IN

00:05:44.997 --> 00:05:46.298
THE PHOTOS.

00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:48.199
&gt;&gt; YOUR DAD’S A JERK, BUT THE

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.768
GUY SENDING THE PHOTOS IS EVEN

00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:52.736
WORSE.

00:05:52.736 --> 00:05:54.071
&gt;&gt; I WAS SO SHOCKED.

00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:55.372
I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:05:55.372 --> 00:05:56.940
I FIGURED THE BEST THING WOULD

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.209
BE JUST TO HIDE THEM, SO I DID.

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:01.911
BUT EVER SINCE THEN, ALL THE

00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:03.412
NORMAL STUFF WE DO AS A FAMILY

00:06:03.412 --> 00:06:05.747
STARTED TO FEEL KIND OF FAKE AND

00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:07.348
WEIRD TO ME.

00:06:07.348 --> 00:06:08.483
&gt;&gt; MUST HAVE BEEN HARD.

00:06:08.483 --> 00:06:10.885
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU OKAY OVER THERE, RIO?

00:06:10.885 --> 00:06:12.219
&gt;&gt; I COULD ONLY TAKE IT FOR SIX

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:14.354
MONTHS.

00:06:14.354 --> 00:06:15.890
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.358
EVERYONE IF MY MOM FOUND OUT.

00:06:22.195 --> 00:06:23.229
&gt;&gt; IF IT’S TOO HARD TO TALK

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.064
ABOUT, YOU DON’T HAVE TO.

00:06:26.064 --> 00:06:27.232
I’VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS I DON’T

00:06:27.232 --> 00:06:29.301
LIKE TALKING ABOUT.

00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:30.402
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO.

00:06:30.402 --> 00:06:34.972
I WANT TO TELL YOU.

00:06:34.972 --> 00:06:36.006
&gt;&gt; HOW COULD YOU MISTAKE A CELL

00:06:36.006 --> 00:06:37.073
PHONE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL?

00:06:37.073 --> 00:06:37.908
&gt;&gt; NOTHING REALLY CHANGED,

00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:38.942
THOUGH.

00:06:38.942 --> 00:06:39.976
I DON’T KNOW IF MOM WAS JUST

00:06:39.976 --> 00:06:41.811
IGNORING THE WHOLE THING, OR IF

00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:43.379
SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER THEY’D WORKED

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:44.347
IT OUT WHEN I WASN’T AROUND.

00:06:44.347 --> 00:06:45.347
&gt;&gt; HASN’T THAT EVER HAPPENED TO

00:06:45.347 --> 00:06:46.281
YOU?

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.749
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING STAYED THE SAME.

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:49.384
MY DAD KEPT TELLING THE SAME

00:06:49.384 --> 00:06:51.953
DUMB JOKES, AND MOM KEPT MAKING

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:57.224
HER STEW TOO SWEET.

00:06:57.224 --> 00:06:58.792
SO I FIGURED MAYBE IT WOULD BE

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:04.396
BETTER IF I JUST DISAPPEARED.

00:07:04.396 --> 00:07:05.832
I GUESS THAT’S ALL I’VE BEEN

00:07:05.832 --> 00:07:09.401
THINKING ABOUT LATELY.

00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:11.302
&gt;&gt; THAT’S A LOT LIKE HOW I FEEL,

00:07:11.302 --> 00:07:12.503
MISS MAZENDA.

00:07:12.503 --> 00:07:13.471
MY PROBLEMS AREN’T AS BAD AS

00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:16.273
YOURS, BUT STILL.

00:07:16.273 --> 00:07:18.175
&gt;&gt; TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

00:07:18.175 --> 00:07:21.077
&gt;&gt; I WAS DATING THIS GIRL AND,

00:07:21.077 --> 00:07:23.012
WELL, SHE HOOKED UP WITH MY DAD.

00:07:23.012 --> 00:07:24.347
&gt;&gt; THAT’S AWFUL.

00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:26.315
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT MY MOM WAS THE ONE

00:07:26.315 --> 00:07:27.883
I WAS ANGRY WITH.

00:07:27.883 --> 00:07:29.852
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID SHE SAY?

00:07:29.852 --> 00:07:31.453
&gt;&gt; SHE SAID STUFF LIKE THAT

00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:33.020
HAPPENS, AND IT WAS MORE

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.055
IMPORTANT THAT THE NEIGHBORS

00:07:34.055 --> 00:07:35.322
DIDN’T FIND OUT.

00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:36.490
SHE DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.459
HOW SHE FELT.

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:40.861
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE SHE THINKS

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:42.362
THE FAMILY’S REPUTATION IS MORE

00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:44.430
IMPORTANT THAN ME.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.466
OR, I DON’T KNOW, MAYBE SHE WAS

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.400
THINKING ABOUT MY FUTURE AND

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.534
STUFF.

00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:51.070
&gt;&gt; I DOUBT IT.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.337
&gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:07:52.337 --> 00:07:53.204
&gt;&gt; I AM.

00:07:53.204 --> 00:07:54.172
SHE DOESN’T CARE ABOUT YOU OR

00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:55.439
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT WHAT’S GOING

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:56.440
ON.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.375
THE ONLY THING SHE CARES ABOUT

00:07:57.375 --> 00:07:58.076
IS--

00:07:58.076 --> 00:07:59.009
[knock on door]

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:00.544
&gt;&gt; HONEY, DINNER’S READY.

00:08:00.544 --> 00:08:02.913
&gt;&gt; YES, MOM.

00:08:07.283 --> 00:08:08.584
&gt;&gt; MISS MAZENDA, WOULD YOU LIKE

00:08:08.584 --> 00:08:11.087
TO DISAPPEAR WITH ME?

00:08:11.087 --> 00:08:12.921
MAYBE IF WE DIE TOGETHER,

00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:14.289
THEY’LL UNDERSTAND HOW WE FEEL

00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:15.390
ABOUT THE WAY THEY’RE TREATING

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.457
US.

00:08:16.457 --> 00:08:18.593
MAYBE THEN THEY’LL REALIZE WHAT

00:08:18.593 --> 00:08:24.030
THEY SHOULD HAVE CARED ABOUT.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.265
&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS STUPID TO HER NOW,

00:08:26.265 --> 00:08:28.101
BUT WHEN SHE LEFT HOME THAT DAY,

00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:29.035
SHE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH WITH

00:08:29.035 --> 00:08:30.269
IT.

00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:31.970
NAKURA’S WORDS GAVE HER THE

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.538
CONFIDENCE SHE NEEDED.

00:08:33.538 --> 00:08:35.940
KNOWING THAT HE SHARED HER PAIN,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.376
SHE FELT COMPELLED TO SEE HIM.

00:08:39.376 --> 00:08:40.577
AT THIS POINT, EVEN IF HE WAS

00:08:40.577 --> 00:08:44.448
LYING, SHE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE.

00:08:44.448 --> 00:08:47.083
OR SO SHE THOUGHT.

00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:51.621
&gt;&gt; YES?

00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:53.989
&gt;&gt; MISS MAZENDA?

00:08:53.989 --> 00:08:56.057
&gt;&gt; YES, I AM.

00:08:56.057 --> 00:08:57.392
ARE YOU MR. NAKURA?

00:08:57.392 --> 00:08:58.426
&gt;&gt; WONDERFUL!

00:08:58.426 --> 00:08:59.360
&gt;&gt; THE SECOND SHE SAW HIS FACE,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.295
SHE BEGAN TO WONDER IF THAT

00:09:01.295 --> 00:09:04.197
REALLY WAS NAKURA.

00:09:04.197 --> 00:09:05.365
BUT SHE WASN’T ABOUT TO TURN

00:09:05.365 --> 00:09:06.433
BACK NOW...

00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:07.434
&gt;&gt; LET’S GET GOING, SHALL WE?

00:09:07.434 --> 00:09:08.335
&gt;&gt; SO SHE IGNORED HER

00:09:08.335 --> 00:09:09.569
SUSPICIONS AND WENT WITH HIM

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:12.004
ANYWAY.

00:09:15.407 --> 00:09:17.408
&gt;&gt; [chuckles]

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.381
&gt;&gt; AND EVEN WHILE THIS WAS

00:09:24.381 --> 00:09:25.415
HAPPENING...

00:09:25.415 --> 00:09:26.450
&gt;&gt; HELLO.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.318
&gt;&gt; HELLO.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.453
&gt;&gt; WE GOOD TO GO?

00:09:29.453 --> 00:09:31.187
&gt;&gt; THE COAST COULDN’T BE

00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:32.321
CLEARER.

00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:33.956
&gt;&gt; SORRY TO TRICK YOU LIKE THIS,

00:09:33.956 --> 00:09:34.523
DOLL FACE...

00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:37.492
&gt;&gt; SHOCK, DEFIANCE, AND REGRET.

00:09:37.492 --> 00:09:39.094
A MIX OF EMOTIONS OVERWHELMED

00:09:39.094 --> 00:09:40.061
HER.

00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:41.563
BUT JUST BEFORE SHE PASSED OUT,

00:09:41.563 --> 00:09:42.930
SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF,

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.465
"THIS IS MY FATE."

00:09:44.465 --> 00:09:46.133
SHE DIDN’T CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO

00:09:46.133 --> 00:09:47.368
HER ANYMORE.

00:09:47.368 --> 00:09:49.269
THIS WAS THE END.

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:50.370
SHE WOULD DISAPPEAR WITHOUT

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.537
ANYONE KNOWING WHAT TRULY

00:09:51.537 --> 00:09:53.373
HAPPENED TO HER, AS IF SHE WAS

00:09:53.373 --> 00:09:55.440
NEVER HERE TO BEGIN WITH.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.876
HOWEVER...

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.521
&gt;&gt; HEH, THE COAST ISN’T EXACTLY

00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:14.123
CLEAR.

00:10:16.525 --> 00:10:19.060
&gt;&gt; AS SHE LAY THERE UNCONSCIOUS,

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.031
THE WORLD OUTSIDE KEPT MOVING...

00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:24.332
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT DOESN’T SOUND LIKE

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:25.700
IT’S GOING TO BE A TOUGH JOB,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.003
BUT BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

00:10:32.972 --> 00:10:34.407
&gt;&gt; WITHOUT ANY CONCERN FOR THE

00:10:34.407 --> 00:10:37.410
FATE THAT AWAITED HER.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.136
&gt;&gt; I CAN’T DO IT.

00:11:08.136 --> 00:11:09.136
THERE’S NO WAY I CAN GET THAT

00:11:09.136 --> 00:11:10.438
KIND OF CASH TOGETHER.

00:11:10.438 --> 00:11:12.105
I SWEAR TO GOD I’M GONNA PAY

00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:13.106
YOU.

00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:15.242
BUT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME,

00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:16.443
SHIKI FROM THE AWAKUSU ISN’T

00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:17.644
GONNA BE TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT.

00:11:17.644 --> 00:11:19.111
AND IF THAT HAPPENS--

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:20.146
&gt;&gt; GRAMPS, I DON’T HAVE TIME FOR

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:21.047
THIS.

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:22.414
AND IT’S NOT ’CAUSE I’M BUSY.

00:11:22.414 --> 00:11:23.482
BUT I’LL BE DAMNED IF I’M GONNA

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:24.683
SPEND MORE THAN A COUPLE OF

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:26.384
MINUTES ON A DOUCHE BAG LIKE

00:11:26.384 --> 00:11:27.218
YOU!

00:11:27.218 --> 00:11:29.420
[door slams]

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.255
&gt;&gt; REALLY AVOID PISSING OFF--

00:11:31.255 --> 00:11:33.490
[loud bang]

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.692
&gt;&gt; [whimpering]

00:11:39.662 --> 00:11:42.164
[gasps]

00:11:42.164 --> 00:11:45.267
[cell phone rings]

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:46.568
&gt;&gt; HEY, I DON’T THINK I NEED TO

00:11:46.568 --> 00:11:48.403
REMIND A TALENTED TRANSPORTER

00:11:48.403 --> 00:11:49.637
SUCH AS YOURSELF HOW TO DO THEIR

00:11:49.637 --> 00:11:50.738
JOB.

00:11:50.738 --> 00:11:52.573
JUST DO WHAT YOU’RE TOLD AND

00:11:52.573 --> 00:11:54.107
NOTHING MORE.

00:11:54.107 --> 00:11:55.476
THROW A SCARE INTO THEM.

00:11:55.476 --> 00:11:56.376
KICK ’EM AROUND A BIT, AND

00:11:56.376 --> 00:11:57.343
THAT’S ALL.

00:11:57.343 --> 00:12:00.580
OKAY? HAVE FUN.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.181
&gt;&gt; THE WORLD KEPT MOVING,

00:12:02.181 --> 00:12:04.383
CHANGING DIRECTION--

00:12:04.383 --> 00:12:05.584
HEADING AWAY FROM THE FATE THE

00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:07.419
GIRL THOUGHT WAS HERS.

00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:08.352
&gt;&gt; YO.

00:12:08.352 --> 00:12:10.354
&gt;&gt; both: HMM?

00:12:14.592 --> 00:12:18.261
[clang]

00:12:18.261 --> 00:12:23.365
[electric zap]

00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:24.666
&gt;&gt; UH!

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.571
UHH--

00:12:30.571 --> 00:12:33.541
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?

00:13:01.397 --> 00:13:02.732
&gt;&gt; UH...

00:13:07.669 --> 00:13:12.406
MM-HMM.

00:13:12.406 --> 00:13:13.842
&gt;&gt; SHE LOOKED, AND ON THE SCREEN

00:13:13.842 --> 00:13:15.743
IT READ, "I’VE BEEN ASKED TO

00:13:15.743 --> 00:13:18.679
TAKE YOU TO A CERTAIN PLACE."

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:21.214
THE BIKE MOVED SILENTLY, BUT

00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:22.815
ONCE IN A WHILE IT BRAYED LIKE A

00:13:22.815 --> 00:13:24.651
HORSE.

00:13:24.651 --> 00:13:27.253
IT ALL SEEMED SO UNREAL TO HER.

00:13:27.253 --> 00:13:28.820
BUT THE RIDER SHE WAS CLINGING

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.756
TO FELT QUITE REAL AS THEY MOVED

00:13:30.756 --> 00:13:33.324
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

00:13:33.324 --> 00:13:34.725
THE GIRL BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT

00:13:34.725 --> 00:13:36.827
THE PERSON EMITTING THIS WARMTH.

00:13:36.827 --> 00:13:38.595
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING, WHAT

00:13:38.595 --> 00:13:40.264
DID THEY KNOW?

00:13:40.264 --> 00:13:42.098
HOW DID THEY LIVE?

00:13:42.098 --> 00:13:44.333
WHEN THIS PERSON LOOKED AT HER,

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:46.469
WHAT DID THEY SEE?

00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:54.175
&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND.

00:14:19.697 --> 00:14:21.732
[door squeaks]

00:14:44.418 --> 00:14:46.486
&gt;&gt; MISS MAZENDA.

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:52.625
IT’S NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:54.692
I’M NAKURA.

00:14:54.692 --> 00:14:56.794
&gt;&gt; HOW DO I KNOW THAT FOR SURE?

00:14:56.794 --> 00:14:57.762
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I’M THE NAKURA WHO

00:14:57.762 --> 00:15:00.197
WANTS TO DISAPPEAR WITH YOU.

00:15:00.197 --> 00:15:02.599
&gt;&gt; IT <i>IS</i> YOU.

00:15:02.599 --> 00:15:04.801
SO THEN, I GUESS YOU’RE THE ONE

00:15:04.801 --> 00:15:06.569
WHO SAVED ME BACK THERE?

00:15:06.569 --> 00:15:08.704
&gt;&gt; RIGHT, THAT’S ME.

00:15:08.704 --> 00:15:09.739
&gt;&gt; I DON’T KNOW HOW TO THANK

00:15:09.739 --> 00:15:10.673
YOU.

00:15:10.673 --> 00:15:12.608
&gt;&gt; WERE YOU REALLY SCARED?

00:15:12.608 --> 00:15:14.243
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:15:14.243 --> 00:15:15.877
&gt;&gt; THAT MUST HAVE BEEN ROUGH.

00:15:15.877 --> 00:15:17.512
&gt;&gt; IT WAS.

00:15:17.512 --> 00:15:18.680
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THE

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.481
KIDNAPPING, THOUGH?

00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:21.815
&gt;&gt; EASY. I’M THE ONE WHO HAD

00:15:21.815 --> 00:15:23.917
THOSE THREE LOSERS KIDNAP YOU.

00:15:23.917 --> 00:15:26.386
CLEVER, HUH?

00:15:26.386 --> 00:15:28.388
OH, AND THAT RESCUE WAS ARRANGED

00:15:28.388 --> 00:15:29.922
BY YOUR TRULY AS WELL.

00:15:29.922 --> 00:15:32.524
&gt;&gt; YOU ARRANGED IT?

00:15:32.524 --> 00:15:33.525
&gt;&gt; LET’S RECAP THE LAST FEW

00:15:33.525 --> 00:15:35.627
MOMENTS OF YOUR LIFE, SHALL WE?

00:15:35.627 --> 00:15:36.562
YOU WERE SCARED WHEN YOU WERE

00:15:36.562 --> 00:15:37.763
KIDNAPPED, DESPITE THE FACT THAT

00:15:37.763 --> 00:15:39.230
YOU WANTED TO DIE IN THE FIRST

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.365
PLACE, AND THAT MADE YOU MAD.

00:15:40.365 --> 00:15:41.799
NOW, IF YOU FOUGHT BACK AGAINST

00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:42.967
YOUR KIDNAPPERS, YOU’D BE

00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:44.301
DENYING THE PART OF YOU THAT

00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:45.469
WANTED TO DIE.

00:15:45.469 --> 00:15:46.770
SO YOU DECIDED TO GIVE UP, AND

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.272
ACCEPTED YOUR FATE.

00:15:48.272 --> 00:15:49.673
BUT NOW THAT YOU’RE SAFE AND

00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:50.740
SOUND, YOU’RE THRILLED YOU

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.775
DIDN’T DIE.

00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:53.809
I WANTED TO SEE THE LOOK ON YOUR

00:15:53.809 --> 00:15:56.679
FACE WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT.

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:57.846
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT YOU LOOKED

00:15:57.846 --> 00:15:59.647
LIKE WHEN YOU CAME FACE TO FACE

00:15:59.647 --> 00:16:00.815
WITH SOMEONE WHO COULD SEE RIGHT

00:16:00.815 --> 00:16:01.849
THROUGH YOUR PATHETIC

00:16:01.849 --> 00:16:04.751
INTENTIONS.

00:16:04.751 --> 00:16:06.353
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD YOU--

00:16:06.353 --> 00:16:08.622
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD I? LET’S SEE.

00:16:08.622 --> 00:16:10.323
IT MIGHT SOUND PHILOSOPHICAL,

00:16:10.323 --> 00:16:11.691
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE A SMART GIRL,

00:16:11.691 --> 00:16:12.692
SO I THINK YOU’LL BE ABLE TO

00:16:12.692 --> 00:16:13.759
UNDERSTAND.

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:14.860
ANYWAY, I’LL TRY TO EXPLAIN IT

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.795
TO YOU.

00:16:15.795 --> 00:16:17.829
SIMPLY PUT, I LOVE HUMANS.

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:18.963
THINK ABOUT IT--

00:16:18.963 --> 00:16:19.998
HUMAN BEINGS ARE THE MOST

00:16:19.998 --> 00:16:21.365
INTERESTING CREATURES YOU COULD

00:16:21.365 --> 00:16:22.734
EVER HOPE TO FIND.

00:16:22.734 --> 00:16:23.701
OH, AND WHEN I SAID I LOVE

00:16:23.701 --> 00:16:25.769
HUMANS, I MEANT <i>ALL</i> HUMANS,

00:16:25.769 --> 00:16:27.638
NOT YOU SPECIFICALLY.

00:16:27.638 --> 00:16:31.874
IMPORTANT DETAIL.

00:16:31.874 --> 00:16:34.010
&gt;&gt; SO THEN, YOU LIED?

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.745
&gt;&gt; YOU’RE GETTING THE PICTURE.

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.346
HOW WONDERFUL.

00:16:37.346 --> 00:16:38.847
COME HERE.

00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:48.388
MANY PEOPLE HAVE JUMPED TO THEIR

00:16:48.388 --> 00:16:49.656
DEATHS FROM THE VERY SPOT YOU’RE

00:16:49.656 --> 00:16:51.425
STANDING ON.

00:16:51.425 --> 00:16:52.492
IT’S NOT REALLY FAMOUS FOR IT OR

00:16:52.492 --> 00:16:53.893
ANYTHING, BUT IT’S HIGH ENOUGH

00:16:53.893 --> 00:16:55.528
THAT IF YOU JUMP, THE FALL <i>WILL</i>

00:16:55.528 --> 00:16:56.662
KILL YOU.

00:16:56.662 --> 00:16:59.532
LOOK. SEE THAT STAIN DOWN THERE?

00:17:06.704 --> 00:17:08.405
TELL ME SOMETHING.

00:17:08.405 --> 00:17:10.741
YOU THINK YOU’RE SPECIAL?

00:17:10.741 --> 00:17:11.875
YOU’RE NOT.

00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:13.476
EVERYONE’S THE SAME.

00:17:13.476 --> 00:17:16.446
EVERYONE LIES, EVERYONE HIDES

00:17:16.446 --> 00:17:17.447
THINGS.

00:17:17.447 --> 00:17:18.313
NO ONE MAKES IT THROUGH THIS

00:17:18.313 --> 00:17:20.515
LIFE BEING <i>COMPLETELY</i> HONEST.

00:17:20.515 --> 00:17:22.517
I BET YOU’VE GOT A COUPLE OF

00:17:22.517 --> 00:17:23.785
JUICY SECRETS YOU WOULDN’T TELL

00:17:23.785 --> 00:17:25.519
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:27.055
SO EXPLAIN THIS.

00:17:27.055 --> 00:17:28.056
HOW COME IT’S OKAY FOR YOU TO

00:17:28.056 --> 00:17:29.557
HAVE SECRETS, BUT NOT YOUR

00:17:29.557 --> 00:17:30.558
PARENTS?

00:17:30.558 --> 00:17:32.559
&gt;&gt; WELL, I--

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:33.860
&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT MY

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.462
THOUGHTS ARE ON THIS?

00:17:35.462 --> 00:17:36.563
I THINK IF YOU’RE HAVING AN

00:17:36.563 --> 00:17:37.530
AFFAIR, OR IF YOUR SPOUSE KNOWS,

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.698
AT TIMES YOU STILL LAUGH AT THE

00:17:38.698 --> 00:17:40.499
SAME DUMB JOKES.

00:17:40.499 --> 00:17:41.533
YOU KEEP EATING THE SAME SWEET

00:17:41.533 --> 00:17:42.501
STEW.

00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:44.770
YOU JUST KEEP GOING.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.438
&gt;&gt; [gasps]

00:17:47.438 --> 00:17:48.573
&gt;&gt; YOU SEE?

00:17:48.573 --> 00:17:50.040
WHATEVER PROBLEMS THEY HAD,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.608
THEY’RE JUST A BIG OLD STAIN ON

00:17:51.608 --> 00:17:52.776
THE PAVEMENT NOW.

00:17:52.776 --> 00:17:53.843
EVERYONE’S THE SAME, NO

00:17:53.843 --> 00:17:55.445
EXCEPTIONS.

00:17:55.445 --> 00:17:59.548
ALL OF THEM EQUAL BEFORE GOD.

00:17:59.548 --> 00:18:01.384
WANT ME TO LET GO?

00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:04.619
&gt;&gt; [breathing uneasily]

00:18:07.589 --> 00:18:11.592
&gt;&gt; YOU GET IT NOW?

00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:14.995
WELL, I GOTTA BOUNCE.

00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:16.362
THANKS A LOT FOR PROVING JUST

00:18:16.362 --> 00:18:18.031
HOW UGLY AND IMMATURE YOU ARE.

00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:19.599
IT’S BEEN REAL.

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.900
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, I DON’T

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.534
REALLY CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS.

00:18:22.534 --> 00:18:23.936
I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.404
HANDLED YOURSELF.

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:26.805
YOU DIDN’T LET ME DOWN, THOUGH.

00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:28.072
YOU’RE JUST AS BORING AS I

00:18:28.072 --> 00:18:29.507
IMAGINED YOU TO BE.

00:18:29.507 --> 00:18:30.774
I KNEW YOU NEVER REALLY WANTED

00:18:30.774 --> 00:18:32.710
TO KILL YOURSELF.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.077
THANKS AGAIN.

00:18:34.077 --> 00:18:35.345
I HAD AN EXCELLENT TIME, MISS

00:18:35.345 --> 00:18:37.580
MAZENDA.

00:18:50.525 --> 00:18:52.693
&gt;&gt; SHE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT.

00:18:52.693 --> 00:18:54.128
SHE THOUGHT MAYBE SHE COULD GET

00:18:54.128 --> 00:18:57.064
BACK AT HIM BY ACTUALLY JUMPING.

00:18:57.064 --> 00:18:58.832
BUT THEN SHE BEGAN TO WONDER IF

00:18:58.832 --> 00:19:00.634
THIS WAS THE EXACT OPPORTUNITY

00:19:00.634 --> 00:19:02.401
SHE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR.

00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:03.669
MAYBE THE HORRIBLE THINGS HE

00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:05.371
SAID WERE WHAT SHE NEEDED TO

00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:07.639
HEAR.

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:14.411
BUT THEN, SOMETHING UNEXPECTED

00:19:14.411 --> 00:19:16.480
HAPPENED.

00:19:46.438 --> 00:19:49.675
&gt;&gt; WAIT.

00:19:49.675 --> 00:19:52.710
TELL ME WHY.

00:20:07.923 --> 00:20:10.058
&gt;&gt; AND AGAIN SHE GOES ABOVE AND

00:20:10.058 --> 00:20:15.530
BEYOND.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:16.698
&gt;&gt; THE GIRL THOUGHT ABOUT HER

00:20:16.698 --> 00:20:19.733
MOTHER AND FATHER...

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:21.568
ABOUT HER FATHER’S LOVER.

00:20:21.568 --> 00:20:22.435
AND THEN AGAIN ABOUT HER

00:20:22.435 --> 00:20:23.636
PARENTS.

00:20:23.636 --> 00:20:24.704
THEY ALL HAD SECRETS SHE’D NEVER

00:20:24.704 --> 00:20:26.706
KNOW ABOUT.

00:20:26.706 --> 00:20:29.574
AND WAS THAT SO TERRIBLE?

00:20:29.574 --> 00:20:30.609
MAYBE THEY WEREN’T AS SELFISH OR

00:20:30.609 --> 00:20:32.111
EVIL OR CORRUPT AS SHE’D

00:20:32.111 --> 00:20:33.845
ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

00:20:33.845 --> 00:20:35.714
MAYBE THEIR BEHAVIOR WASN’T A

00:20:35.714 --> 00:20:37.748
SIGN OF WEAKNESS, OR SOME KIND

00:20:37.748 --> 00:20:39.517
OF COMPROMISE.

00:20:39.517 --> 00:20:41.585
AS SHE LOOKED FOR THE WAY HOME,

00:20:41.585 --> 00:20:42.685
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT FORGIVING

00:20:42.685 --> 00:20:47.924
THEM, AND KEEPING IT A SECRET.

00:20:47.924 --> 00:20:49.658
EVER SINCE THEN, THE WORLD HAS

00:20:49.658 --> 00:20:51.227
LOOKED DIFFERENT.

00:20:51.227 --> 00:20:52.661
EVERYONE SHE SAW HAD THEIR OWN

00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:54.596
LIVES TO LIVE, WITH THEIR OWN

00:20:54.596 --> 00:20:56.097
LITTLE SECRETS.

00:20:56.097 --> 00:20:57.565
AND SHE REALIZED THAT WAS

00:20:57.565 --> 00:20:58.666
NORMAL.

00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:00.067
&gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

00:21:00.067 --> 00:21:01.135
I’LL TAKE YOU WHEREVER.

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.769
JUST BUY ME FOOD.

00:21:02.769 --> 00:21:04.071
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:21:04.071 --> 00:21:05.639
HOW ABOUT A BOOKSTORE?

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:07.006
&gt;&gt; UH, YEAH...

00:21:07.006 --> 00:21:07.941
THERE’S, LIKE, A TON OF

00:21:07.941 --> 00:21:08.875
BOOKSTORES AROUND HERE.

00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:10.143
&gt;&gt; EVEN THESE TWO, AS NORMAL AS

00:21:10.143 --> 00:21:12.010
THEY SEEM, PROBABLY HAVE SECRETS

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.745
OF THEIR OWN.

00:21:12.745 --> 00:21:13.746
&gt;&gt; JUST THOUGHT I’D LOOK FOR

00:21:13.746 --> 00:21:14.479
SOME MANGA.

00:21:14.479 --> 00:21:15.180
&gt;&gt; FEELINGS THEY COULD NEVER

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.248
TELL ANYONE.

00:21:16.248 --> 00:21:18.583
&gt;&gt; PLEASE, WAIT!

00:21:18.583 --> 00:21:21.118
SEIJI, ARE YOU SURE YOU DON’T

00:21:21.118 --> 00:21:22.153
KNOW ANYTHING?

00:21:22.153 --> 00:21:23.087
&gt;&gt; LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:21:23.087 --> 00:21:25.188
&gt;&gt; BUT LISTEN, SHE EVEN MISSED

00:21:25.188 --> 00:21:26.757
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

00:21:26.757 --> 00:21:28.191
&gt;&gt; I SAID I DON’T KNOW ANYTHING!

00:21:28.191 --> 00:21:29.659
&gt;&gt; WAIT. HOLD ON.

00:21:29.659 --> 00:21:30.626
&gt;&gt; HELLO!

00:21:30.626 --> 00:21:33.562
HEY, YOU GOOD DOWN THERE?

00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:38.600
&gt;&gt; I WONDER WHAT THAT’S ABOUT.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.167
&gt;&gt; HEH HEH.

00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:40.834
SHE TOTALLY WANTS ME.

00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:41.835
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:21:41.835 --> 00:21:43.003
&gt;&gt; THAT CHICK WITH THE GLASSES

00:21:43.003 --> 00:21:44.271
HAS A CRUSH ON ME.

00:21:44.271 --> 00:21:45.673
BUT SHE’S AFRAID OF ALL THE

00:21:45.673 --> 00:21:47.140
DANGER AND RISK A GUY LIKE ME

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.541
BRINGS TO THE TABLE.

00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:49.709
OH, YEAH, I’M RAD.

00:21:49.709 --> 00:21:50.810
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU SPEAK A LANGUAGE THAT

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:51.778
I KNOW TOO?

00:21:51.778 --> 00:21:54.546
&gt;&gt; FOR THAT BOY, AND FOR THIS

00:21:54.546 --> 00:21:56.915
GIRL, THE WORLD THEY SEE RIGHT

00:21:56.915 --> 00:21:59.750
NOW IS NOT NECESSARILY REALITY.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.086
AND SHE FOUND HERSELF THINKING

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:03.020
HOW WONDERFUL IT WOULD BE IF SHE

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.621
COULD TELL SOMEONE WHAT SHE’D

00:22:04.621 --> 00:22:05.789
LEARNED.

00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:07.757
THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

00:22:07.757 --> 00:22:09.158
THE WORLD REALLY ISN’T AS BAD AS

00:22:09.158 --> 00:22:11.594
YOU THINK.

00:22:13.929 --> 00:22:16.031
&gt;&gt; SO NOBODY TOLD ME YOU

00:22:16.031 --> 00:22:17.632
SWITCHED PROFESSIONS AND BECAME

00:22:17.632 --> 00:22:21.569
A DEFENDER OF THE INNOCENT.

00:22:21.569 --> 00:22:22.937
I DIDN’T EXPECT THAT.

00:22:22.937 --> 00:22:24.105
SEE, I THOUGHT I HIRED YOU FOR

00:22:24.105 --> 00:22:26.873
YOUR SKILLS AS A COURIER.

00:22:30.076 --> 00:22:31.311
NO WAY!

00:22:31.311 --> 00:22:32.978
I’M JUST IZAYA ORIHARA, THE INFO

00:22:32.978 --> 00:22:37.282
BROKER, NOT SOME EVIL VILLAIN.

00:22:37.282 --> 00:22:38.850
BUT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GO OUT

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.852
LIKE THAT, WHO AM I TO TELL THEM

00:22:40.852 --> 00:22:42.921
THEY CAN’T, YOU KNOW?

00:22:45.756 --> 00:22:47.190
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN,

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.160
