00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:26.468
AND A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AT THAT.

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.336
IT WAS A FOGGY NIGHT ON AN OLD

00:15:28.336 --> 00:15:29.571
MOUNTAIN ROAD WHEN SHE PASSED

00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:31.506
ME.

00:15:31.506 --> 00:15:32.775
SHE FLEW BY AT AN INCREDIBLE

00:15:32.775 --> 00:15:34.176
SPEED.

00:15:34.176 --> 00:15:35.477
SHE WAS A TERRIFYING BUT

00:15:35.477 --> 00:15:38.313
BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.

00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:39.582
IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT SHE

00:15:39.582 --> 00:15:43.519
WAS NOT OF THIS WORLD.

00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:44.687
WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY INN AND

00:15:44.687 --> 00:15:46.455
RELAYED WHAT I HAD SEEN, I WAS

00:15:46.455 --> 00:15:49.292
TOLD THAT IT WAS A DULLAHAN.

00:15:49.292 --> 00:15:50.393
AND THAT IT HAD BEEN IN THE AREA

00:15:50.393 --> 00:15:51.760
FOR AGES.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.129
&gt;&gt; SO WHY DOESN’T THE DULLAHAN

00:15:53.129 --> 00:15:55.431
IN YOUR SKETCHBOOKS HAVE A HEAD?

00:15:55.431 --> 00:15:57.266
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I CAN’T DRAW IT.

00:15:57.266 --> 00:15:58.735
THE MORE I TRY, THE MORE OUT OF

00:15:58.735 --> 00:16:01.370
PLACE IT LOOKS.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.471
I REMEMBER WHAT I SAW SO

00:16:02.471 --> 00:16:04.908
CLEARLY, BUT SOME REASON I CAN’T

00:16:04.908 --> 00:16:07.811
EXPRESS THAT ON PAPER.

00:16:07.811 --> 00:16:09.245
&gt;&gt; DID YOU SEE WHAT COLOR HER

00:16:09.245 --> 00:16:10.847
HAIR WAS OR HER EYES?

00:16:10.847 --> 00:16:12.249
WHAT WAS THE EXPRESSION ON HER

00:16:12.249 --> 00:16:13.182
FACE?

00:16:13.182 --> 00:16:15.652
&gt;&gt; HEH, IF I KNEW ALL THAT, I

00:16:15.652 --> 00:16:17.387
WOULDN’T HAVE A PROBLEM DRAWING

00:16:17.387 --> 00:16:18.855
IT.

00:16:18.855 --> 00:16:20.257
YOU KNOW, I WAS TALKING TO

00:16:20.257 --> 00:16:21.625
SOMEONE ABOUT THIS THE OTHER

00:16:21.625 --> 00:16:22.559
DAY.

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:23.861
HE WAS AN ODD GUY.

00:16:23.861 --> 00:16:25.329
BUT HE SAID THE DRAWING WAS

00:16:25.329 --> 00:16:26.563
PERFECT AS IT WAS.

00:16:26.563 --> 00:16:27.832
ACCORDING TO HIM, SHE DIDN’T

00:16:27.832 --> 00:16:30.668
NEED A HEAD.

00:16:30.668 --> 00:16:33.470
HE WAS PRETTY STRANGE, THOUGH.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:34.505
&gt;&gt; SO WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED

00:16:34.505 --> 00:16:35.840
WITH DRAWING THIS THING?

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.442
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST

00:16:37.442 --> 00:16:39.610
MAGICAL THING I HAVE EVER SEEN.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.579
IT WAS THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE

00:16:41.579 --> 00:16:42.913
OF MY LIFE.

00:16:42.913 --> 00:16:44.315
AND I WANT TO GET THE MEMORY

00:16:44.315 --> 00:16:45.350
BACK.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.752
I DON’T EVER WANT TO LOSE IT.

00:16:53.758 --> 00:16:55.193
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, GRAMPS.

00:16:55.193 --> 00:16:56.561
THANKS.

00:16:56.561 --> 00:17:00.465
&gt;&gt; I SEE.

00:17:00.465 --> 00:17:01.767
YOU DON’T REMEMBER, DO YOU?

00:17:01.767 --> 00:17:04.202
RIDING PAST SOME GUY HIDING IN

00:17:04.202 --> 00:17:07.473
THE BUSHES.

00:17:07.473 --> 00:17:08.407
&gt;&gt; I DON’T.

00:17:08.407 --> 00:17:09.608
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU DON’T KNOW FOR SURE

00:17:09.608 --> 00:17:10.842
IF THAT DULLAHAN WAS ACTUALLY

00:17:10.842 --> 00:17:11.777
YOU.

00:17:11.777 --> 00:17:13.245
FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE COULD HAVE

00:17:13.245 --> 00:17:15.281
MADE THAT WHOLE THING UP.

00:17:15.281 --> 00:17:16.748
&gt;&gt; IT WAS REAL, AND IT WAS ME.

00:17:16.748 --> 00:17:18.350
I KNOW IT.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:22.221
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:17:22.221 --> 00:17:24.423
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS I DOING THAT NIGHT?

00:17:24.423 --> 00:17:25.992
WHERE WAS I GOING AND WHY WAS

00:17:25.992 --> 00:17:28.227
I GOING THERE?

00:17:28.227 --> 00:17:29.428
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SURE THAT’S REALLY

00:17:29.428 --> 00:17:30.763
IMPORTANT?

00:17:30.763 --> 00:17:32.699
&gt;&gt; HUH?

00:17:32.699 --> 00:17:34.333
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU ARE AMAZINGLY

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:35.802
AMBIGUOUS AND UNQUESTIONABLY

00:17:35.802 --> 00:17:37.670
UNIQUE.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.306
BUT AS THINGS ARE, YOU ARE STILL

00:17:39.306 --> 00:17:40.740
MILES AWAY FROM ACHIEVING YOUR

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.642
GOAL.

00:17:42.642 --> 00:17:43.843
&gt;&gt; WHAT’S YOUR POINT?

00:17:43.843 --> 00:17:45.645
&gt;&gt; I’LL BE BLUNT.

00:17:45.645 --> 00:17:49.349
&gt;&gt; LET IT GO.

00:17:49.349 --> 00:17:50.517
THAT STRANGE GUY IN THE

00:17:50.517 --> 00:17:51.919
PAINTER’S STORY, MAYBE WHAT HE

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:53.653
SAID WAS RIGHT.

00:17:53.653 --> 00:17:55.488
I MEAN, MAYBE YOU ARE COMPLETE

00:17:55.488 --> 00:17:59.660
WITHOUT YOUR HEAD.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.462
PERHAPS THE TIME HAS COME TO

00:18:01.462 --> 00:18:03.030
MOVE ON.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:04.264
YOU KNOW WHAT, LET’S GO

00:18:04.264 --> 00:18:05.599
SOMEWHERE.

00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:08.402
ANYWHERE.

00:18:08.402 --> 00:18:10.003
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

00:18:10.003 --> 00:18:11.305
AND IF YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO GO

00:18:11.305 --> 00:18:12.773
BACK HOME, NO MATTER WHAT, I’LL

00:18:12.773 --> 00:18:13.741
MAKE IT HAPPEN.

00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:14.976
HMM?

00:18:14.976 --> 00:18:16.844
I’LL EVEN GO WITH YOU.

00:18:16.844 --> 00:18:17.912
YOU KNOW, THAT WAY YOU AND I

00:18:17.912 --> 00:18:18.579
CAN...

00:18:18.579 --> 00:18:19.613
&gt;&gt; IT’S NOT THAT I DON’T LIKE

00:18:19.613 --> 00:18:21.683
YOU, BUT I’M QUITE HAPPY WITH

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:22.717
OUR LIVING ARRANGEMENTS AS THEY

00:18:22.717 --> 00:18:24.619
ARE.

00:18:24.619 --> 00:18:25.854
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU DON’T HAVE TO--

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:27.589
&gt;&gt; I SAID I’M FINE.

00:18:27.589 --> 00:18:28.690
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.859
[chair rolls]

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:33.395
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED TO

00:18:33.395 --> 00:18:34.696
CHANGE THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:35.364
ALL...

00:18:35.364 --> 00:18:39.934
&gt;&gt; THAT’S ENOUGH.

00:18:39.934 --> 00:18:40.835
[door sliding]

00:18:40.835 --> 00:18:42.637
[slams]

00:18:42.637 --> 00:18:43.738
&gt;&gt; [sighs]

00:18:43.738 --> 00:18:45.640
I GUESS THAT MEANS WE DO PROCESS

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.741
WHAT WE FEEL A LITTLE BIT

00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:49.011
DIFFERENTLY.

00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:49.845
ALL RIGHT.

00:18:49.845 --> 00:18:51.513
BACK TO THE SUBJECT AT HAND.

00:18:54.817 --> 00:18:57.319
CELTY’S STORY--ACTUALLY, OUR

00:18:57.319 --> 00:18:59.422
STORY STARTS BACK UP ON THE

00:18:59.422 --> 00:19:00.523
SHIP.

00:19:00.523 --> 00:19:02.425
SHE CONVINCED A CREW MEMBER TO

00:19:02.425 --> 00:19:03.593
SMUGGLE HER ABOARD.

00:19:03.593 --> 00:19:05.094
BUT IT DIDN’T TAKE LONG FOR HER

00:19:05.094 --> 00:19:06.696
TO REALIZE HOW MUCH SHE STOOD

00:19:06.696 --> 00:19:09.499
OUT.

00:19:09.499 --> 00:19:10.866
I’VE KNOWN HER FOR SO LONG THAT

00:19:10.866 --> 00:19:13.069
I DON’T EVEN NOTICE IT ANYMORE.

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:17.874
&gt;&gt; AH.

00:19:17.874 --> 00:19:18.942
&gt;&gt; BUT THE FIRST TIME I SAW HER

00:19:18.942 --> 00:19:20.911
WAS QUITE SHOCKING.

00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:24.380
I WAS ONLY FOUR AT THE TIME.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.415
I WAS HEADING BACK TO JAPAN WITH

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:26.483
MY FATHER.

00:19:26.483 --> 00:19:27.350
DADDY! DADDY, COME HERE.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.951
THIS WOMAN I JUST SAW...

00:19:27.951 --> 00:19:29.720
MY FATHER SHINGEN IS NOT A

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.021
NORMAL PERSON BY ANY MEANS.

00:19:31.021 --> 00:19:32.556
YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS!

00:19:32.556 --> 00:19:34.525
I TOLD HIM WHAT I HAD SEEN, AND,

00:19:34.525 --> 00:19:36.460
IF HE WERE A NORMAL PARENT, HE

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.428
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE JUST LAUGHED

00:19:37.428 --> 00:19:38.729
AND IGNORED IT.

00:19:38.729 --> 00:19:39.830
BUT NOT MY DAD.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.398
HE’S DIFFERENT.

00:19:41.398 --> 00:19:42.666
PERHAPS BEING INQUISITIVE COMES

00:19:42.666 --> 00:19:44.501
WITH BEING A DOCTOR.

00:19:44.501 --> 00:19:46.938
BUT HE WAS INTRIGUED.

00:19:46.938 --> 00:19:48.973
&gt;&gt; MY LADY, I DO APOLOGIZE,

00:19:48.973 --> 00:19:50.742
BUT IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE

00:19:50.742 --> 00:19:52.644
NO HEAD?

00:19:52.644 --> 00:19:54.411
&gt;&gt; HE OFFERED HER A DEAL.

00:19:54.411 --> 00:19:55.580
HE SAID IF SHE ALLOWED HIM TO

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.881
DISSECT HER, THEN HE WOULD IN

00:19:56.881 --> 00:19:58.082
RETURN OFFER HER A PLACE TO

00:19:58.082 --> 00:20:00.952
STAY.

00:20:00.952 --> 00:20:02.387
SHE AGREED.

00:20:02.387 --> 00:20:03.655
SHE DID WHAT SHE HAD TO.

00:20:03.655 --> 00:20:05.823
BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN NERVOUS.

00:20:10.062 --> 00:20:11.529
I’VE TALKED TO HER ABOUT THIS

00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:12.530
BEFORE.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:13.598
BUT SHE DOESN’T SEEM TO REMEMBER

00:20:13.598 --> 00:20:14.867
IT.

00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:15.868
&gt;&gt; [grunting]

00:20:15.868 --> 00:20:17.569
&gt;&gt; NORMAL ANESTHESIA DIDN’T WORK

00:20:17.569 --> 00:20:18.671
ON HER.

00:20:18.671 --> 00:20:19.572
THE SHOCK MUST HAVE BEEN

00:20:19.572 --> 00:20:21.774
TREMENDOUS.

00:20:21.774 --> 00:20:23.609
SHE DOES EXPERIENCE PAIN,

00:20:23.609 --> 00:20:25.177
ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS ACUTE AS

00:20:25.177 --> 00:20:26.979
HUMANS.

00:20:26.979 --> 00:20:30.883
&gt;&gt; [whimpers]

00:20:30.883 --> 00:20:33.086
&gt;&gt; SHE HAS NO HEART.

00:20:33.086 --> 00:20:34.620
ALL OF HER ORGANS ARE THERE, BUT

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.589
NONE OF THEM ARE FUNCTIONING.

00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:37.891
SHE HAS BLOOD VESSELS, BUT

00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:39.458
THERE’S NO BLOOD CIRCULATING

00:20:39.458 --> 00:20:40.593
THROUGH THEM.

00:20:40.593 --> 00:20:42.061
SHE’S LIKE A WALKING ANATOMICAL

00:20:42.061 --> 00:20:43.196
MODEL.

00:20:43.196 --> 00:20:48.034
LOOK AT THAT.

00:20:48.034 --> 00:20:49.168
&gt;&gt; [exclaims]

00:20:49.168 --> 00:20:50.136
&gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR HER TO

00:20:50.136 --> 00:20:53.507
DIE?

00:20:53.507 --> 00:20:54.841
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU BELIEVE MY DAD DID

00:20:54.841 --> 00:20:55.742
THAT?

00:20:55.742 --> 00:20:57.444
HAD HIS FOUR-YEAR-OLD SON

00:20:57.444 --> 00:20:59.713
DISSECT A WOMAN?

00:20:59.713 --> 00:21:01.581
BUT IT WAS OPPORTUNITIES LIKE

00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:03.183
THIS THAT MADE ME THE DOCTOR

00:21:03.183 --> 00:21:04.484
THAT I AM TODAY.

00:21:04.484 --> 00:21:05.585
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL BE

00:21:05.585 --> 00:21:07.621
USEFUL LATER.

00:21:07.621 --> 00:21:08.722
&gt;&gt; GO ON.

00:21:08.722 --> 00:21:12.092
&gt;&gt; [exclaims]

00:21:12.092 --> 00:21:13.493
THE MOMENT I SAW HER, I WAS

00:21:13.493 --> 00:21:16.997
CAPTIVATED.

00:21:16.997 --> 00:21:18.466
WE’VE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER FOR

00:21:18.466 --> 00:21:20.635
20 YEARS, AND I STILL FEEL THE

00:21:20.635 --> 00:21:22.102
SAME WAY.

00:21:22.102 --> 00:21:24.572
SHE WORKS AS A TRANSPORTER NOW.

00:21:24.572 --> 00:21:25.640
BUT SHE STILL CONTINUES TO

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.609
SEARCH FOR HER HEAD.

00:21:28.609 --> 00:21:29.710
IF SHE DOES FIND IT SOME DAY,

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.980
THEN WHAT?

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.815
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HER?

00:21:34.815 --> 00:21:36.885
I MEAN, IS HER WILL THE SAME AS

00:21:36.885 --> 00:21:38.119
HER HEAD’S WILL?

00:21:38.119 --> 00:21:40.555
OR MAYBE...

00:21:40.555 --> 00:21:41.723
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU RECORDING?

00:21:41.723 --> 00:21:43.524
&gt;&gt; OH, THIS?

00:21:43.524 --> 00:21:44.660
IT’S NOTHING.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.861
I’M JUST DOCUMENTING THE DETAILS

00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:47.062
OF OUR HAPPY LITTLE LIFE

00:21:47.062 --> 00:21:48.730
TOGETHER FOR GENERATIONS TO

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.265
COME.

00:21:50.265 --> 00:21:52.601
&gt;&gt; WHATEVER. JUST KEEP IT DOWN.

00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:54.670
I’M TRYING TO SLEEP.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.006

&gt;&gt; HUH?

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:12.088
EVERYONE KNOWS A PROPER DULLAHAN

00:22:12.088 --> 00:22:14.591
SHOULD CARRY ITS HEAD WITH IT.

00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:15.658
&gt;&gt; IT’S GREAT THE WAY IT IS.

00:22:15.658 --> 00:22:18.294
IT DOESN’T NEED A HEAD.

00:22:18.294 --> 00:22:20.029
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE IT NEEDS A HEAD.

00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:21.097
YOU’VE NEVER KNOWN THE REAL

00:22:21.097 --> 00:22:22.899
THING, SO YOU DON’T KNOW.

00:22:22.899 --> 00:22:24.667

00:22:24.667 --> 00:22:25.835
EVER.

&gt;&gt; HMM?

00:22:27.904 --> 00:22:29.639
&gt;&gt; BUT I STILL SAY SHE’S BETTER

00:22:29.639 --> 00:22:31.608
WITHOUT A HEAD.

00:22:31.608 --> 00:22:32.542
SHE LOOKS MORE CHARMING THAT

00:22:32.542 --> 00:22:33.010
WAY.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.577
IN A WORD, PERFECT.

00:22:34.577 --> 00:22:36.613
SO, LOOK, STOP WORRYING ABOUT

00:22:36.613 --> 00:22:37.848
NOT BEING ABLE TO DRAW IT.

00:22:37.848 --> 00:22:39.683
YOU DON’T REALLY NEED TO.

00:22:39.683 --> 00:22:43.754

&gt;&gt; [mutters] YOU’RE CRAZY.

00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:47.024
SHE NEEDS A HEAD.

&gt;&gt; STOP THAT.

00:22:48.091 --> 00:22:49.159
YOU’RE GONNA RUIN IT.

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.594
