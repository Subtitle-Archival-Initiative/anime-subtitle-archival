350
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:18,716
Well... I would most likely take
the Fuhrer's wife as a hostage.

351
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:22,749
Why bother
doing such a thing?

352
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,949
He must know that's futile.

353
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:30,749
So he's going to take
a pointless hostage

354
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,782
and make sure that he's
branded as a traitor...?

355
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:35,482
Even further
proof that humans

356
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:38,282
are relentlessly
ridiculous creatures.
