1
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:35,315
[HAWKEYE]
Colonel... Please.

2
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:38,948
You don't have to do this...

3
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:40,993
Don't sacrifice everything...
for my sake...

4
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:44,458
[GOLD-TOOTH]]
But you will do it...

5
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,421
Won't you... Mustang?

6
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,904
[GOLD-TOOTH]
Well?

7
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:11,513
[ROY]
All right.

8
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:12,974
[GOLD-TOOTH]
Good...

9
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:14,644
I knew you'd see reason.

10
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:17,984
[ROY]
All right, Lieutenant...

11
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:21,449
I won't perform
the transmutation.

12
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:25,625
[GOLD-TOOTH]
You'd forsake her...

13
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,419
How very cold of you.

14
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:28,839
[ROY]
You should talk...

15
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:30,718
You seem to
have no problem

16
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,056
treating these men as
your sacrificial pawns.

17
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:34,893
[GOLD-TOOTH]
These men are more than happy

18
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:37,231
to lay down their
lives for me...

19
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,441
They were abandoned...

20
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:39,986
Left by their parents,

21
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:42,199
they would have all
died without my care...

22
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,869
I saw to their education...

23
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:47,042
I gave them a reason
to keep on living...

24
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,338
I infused their very
existence with purpose.

25
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:52,052
For the kindness
I showed them,

26
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:53,556
they remain grateful to me.

27
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,141
[ROY] And that's just
the sort of overconfidence

28
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,145
that could get you in trouble.

29
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:59,066
[GOLD-TOOTH] Hmmm?
What do you--?

30
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:04,703
[SCAR]
He vanished.

31
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:17,311
[GERSO] Oh yeah,
we're grateful alright...

32
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,735
let me show you just
how grateful we are.

33
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:22,487
[GOLD-TOOTH]
No! Let me go!

34
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:24,910
[GERSO] Let every one down
there loose right now...

35
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,913
or that's the end of you.

36
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,919
[GOLD-TOOTH] No, wait!
Just listen to me...!

37
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,422
I'm the only
doctor here right now

38
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:32,759
who can use alchemy...

39
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:35,681
Without me you can
never save the woman...

40
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:36,683
Don't you understand?!

41
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:41,150
[GERSO] Hah...!
Yeah, nice try, doctor...

42
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,404
But I won't fall for that.

43
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:58,101
[MAY CHANG]
A Philosopher's Stone!

44
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:02,777
[ROY]
Outta my way!

45
00:04:06,952 --> 00:04:07,954
[ROY]
Lieutenant!

46
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,960
[ROY]
Come on--stay with me!

47
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,672
Lieutenant, open your eyes!

48
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,013
[ROY] Lieutenant!
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

49
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:21,898
[DARIUS]
You all right?

50
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:33,129
[MAY CHANG]
I have to get that stone!

51
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,020
Grrrrrrr!

52
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:43,859
[MAY CHANG]
She comes first.

53
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:45,654
Let me help!

54
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:55,633
[ROY]
Lieutenant!

55
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,845
[MAY CHANG] I've stopped
the bleeding for now...

56
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:00,350
but she still needs
to see a doctor.

57
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,605
[ROY] Thank you...
I owe you one.

58
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:11,038
[HAWKEYE] Colonel...
I'm so sorry.

59
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:15,004
[ROY] No, don't speak...
Just rest now.

60
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,302
[HAWKEYE]
You understood my signal...

61
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:21,392
I'm not sure how,
but I'm glad.

62
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:24,732
[ROY] We've been
together long enough...

63
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,402
And besides...

64
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:28,699
I know that glare. It means

65
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:32,540
"use human transmutation
and I'll shoot you."

66
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:39,721
[DARIUS] That's
the last one of 'em.

67
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:42,560
[ROY] Everyone, thank
you for all of your help.

68
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,231
[DARIUS] Sure...
It was no problem at all.

69
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,612
[MAY CHANG]
Oh, right! The Stone!

70
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,626
[footsteps]

71
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,222
[ROY]
King Bradley...

72
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,528
[ROY] His wounds
aren't regenerating.

73
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,785
[BRADLEY] It's been
quite some time...

74
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:12,787
eh, Colonel Mustang?

75
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,544
[ROY]
Indeed it has, sir.

76
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,091
I'm afraid I'd be lying

77
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,470
if I said you were
looking as good as ever.

78
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:24,769
[BRIGGS SOLDIER 1]
Here, King Bradley!

79
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:25,771
Take this!

80
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:27,525
Ow!!

81
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,529
Arrgh!

82
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,039
[splash]

83
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:13,825
[BRADLEY] Knowing that
weakling's heart of yours,

84
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:16,455
I thought if someone
dear to you fell...

85
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:18,292
you would do
anything to save her,

86
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,296
even if it meant
human transmutation.

87
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:23,512
[ROY] There was a
time when I might have...

88
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:25,516
but that time
is behind me.

89
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:28,020
Luckily... I have
people by my side now

90
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,191
who will stop me
from being reckless,

91
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:32,655
and keep me headed
down the right path.

92
00:07:34,324 --> 00:07:37,038
[BRADLEY] Hmph! And here
I was under the impression

93
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:38,708
you were all
pathetic creatures

94
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,004
who could never
learn a lesson properly...

95
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,386
but apparently there are
those like you who can learn--

96
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:45,388
who can change...

97
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:49,437
That's one more reason why
I can't stand you humans...

98
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:51,943
[BRADLEY]
It infuriates me

99
00:07:51,943 --> 00:07:54,657
when I can't predict
how you'll behave.

100
00:07:58,289 --> 00:07:59,291
Huh?!

101
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:01,629
[SCAR]
What's wrong?

102
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,092
[MAY CHANG]
He's under us...

103
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:06,430
Their leader's still
down there somewhere...

104
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:09,019
[GOLD-TOOTH]
Noo...!

105
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,898
I won't let you
interfere with him!

106
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:12,651
[GERSO]
Oh, give it up, doctor...

107
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:14,822
You're not going anywhere!

108
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:20,626
[ZAMPANO]
Gerso!

109
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,212
[ZAMPANO]
Get up!

110
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:26,011
[GERSO]
Run... get outta here!

111
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:33,568
[DARIUS]
This is bad.

112
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,699
[MAY CHANG] He's right...
something's coming...

113
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:39,037
something awful.

114
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:11,351
[ROY] Please...
Look after her for now.

115
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:25,922
[HAWKEYE]
Colonel!

116
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:30,641
[GOLD-TOOTH]
Hehehehe!

117
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:33,647
[GOLD-TOOTH] Very good.
Job well done, Bradley.

118
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:36,151
That's the kind of man
I brought you up to be--

119
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:38,030
[schling]

120
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:44,125
[gagging]

121
00:09:57,778 --> 00:09:59,114
[PRIDE] Well,
Colonel Mustang...

122
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:01,118
looks like
you're our fifth.

123
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:02,495
[BRADLEY]
That's right...

124
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:04,165
The last one.

125
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:11,179
[barking]

126
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:15,647
[YOUNGSTER]
Not again...

127
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:17,024
What's with all the noise

128
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,320
and smoke around here today?

129
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:23,747
[YOUNGSTER]
Oh...

130
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:26,042
it looks like the
eclipse has begun.

131
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,508
<i>[NARRATOR]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

132
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,570
[PRIDE]
I was really hoping

133
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,532
that I wouldn't have
to resort to this...

134
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:43,202
but there is no choice...

135
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,707
We have run
out of time now.

136
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,586
[BRADLEY]
Whether you like it or not,

137
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:50,174
we're going to force
you to open the portal...

138
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:51,176
Prepare yourself.

139
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:53,388
[ROY]
No. I won't do it.

140
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:56,353
[BRADLEY] As I said, it doesn't
matter if you want to...

141
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:58,357
Pride has just
assimilated an alchemist

142
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:01,906
who possesses knowledge
of human transmutation.

143
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:06,749
[BRADLEY] He has
the necessary formula.

144
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,379
[PRIDE]
He's safely pinned...

145
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:12,176
Move back, Wrath... Now.

146
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:21,946
[coughs]

147
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:25,244
[BRADLEY]
I wonder...

148
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:28,710
What will be taken from
you in exchange, Mustang...

149
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:30,254
Ahhhh!!

150
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:32,216
[HAWKEYE]
Colonel!

151
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:34,220
[MAY CHANG] No! You'll
get caught up in it, too!

152
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:39,773
[HAWKEYE]
Colonel!

153
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:58,101
[BRADLEY]
The transmutation's complete.

154
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:02,485
[ZAMPANO] That's the
old guy with the glasses?

155
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:04,238
[HAWKEYE]
The colonel?

156
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:05,909
[BRADLEY] Oh,
Mustang's still alive...

157
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:06,911
Right about now,

158
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:10,042
the good Colonel should
be joining our Father.

159
00:12:11,086 --> 00:12:12,088
[BRADLEY]
Although...

160
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:14,635
I can't vouch for his
physical well-being.

161
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:18,183
[BRADLEY]
Take a good look...

162
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:21,106
See what kind of
shape I'm in right now?

163
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:25,949
[BRADLEY] Who among
you would care for

164
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:29,288
the illustrious honor of taking
down the Fuhrer of Amestris?

165
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:30,959
A Chimera?

166
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,169
The outsider?

167
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:33,798
Mustang's dog?

168
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:35,885
Or perhaps...

169
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:41,479
You'd all like to
come at me at once?

170
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:43,901
<i>I don't think we can beat him</i>

171
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,905
<i>even when he's in this shape.</i>

172
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:47,868
[GERSO]
Right there...

173
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,372
beneath the hole in the ceiling.

174
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,043
[GERSO] When May
said their leader

175
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:53,378
was right below us,

176
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:55,717
that crazy doctor guy said

177
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:58,723
that he wouldn't let us
interfere with him, right...?

178
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:00,560
So I'm guessing
Bradley doesn't want us

179
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,229
to go down there either.

180
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,526
[SCAR] Ah...
so that's the center.

181
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:06,404
[MAY CHANG]
It must be.

182
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:08,743
That's where the chi
felt the strongest.

183
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:11,206
[SCAR]
Well then...

184
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:50,785
[ED]
Colonel!

185
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,375
[PRIDE]
I've brought him to you...

186
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,377
He's our fifth.

187
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:58,593
[FATHER] Hmm... I wish
we could say that makes

188
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:00,597
all five of the
required sacrifices...

189
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,268
but Alphonse Elric
has not arrived yet.

190
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:05,648
[ED]
Colonel, are you okay?!

191
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:06,650
Say something!

192
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:08,696
[ROY]
Fullmetal?

193
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,581
Where... where are we?

194
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:18,256
[ED] The bearded
guy's hideout...

195
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:19,676
Now what happened?

196
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:21,429
What did they do to you?

197
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:23,559
[ROY] I was flung
into a strange place,

198
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,563
into a gateway of some sort.

199
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:27,024
[ED]
The portal?!

200
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:29,780
That means... something
was taken from you...

201
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,702
But, your arms and
legs are still here...

202
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:34,539
[ROY]
Fullmetal...

203
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,334
I don't know
how you can expect

204
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,965
to see my condition when
it's this dark in here.

205
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,300
[ED]
What do you mea--?

206
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,603
[ROY]
It's all dark... pitch black...

207
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:52,324
The lights...
Where are the lights?

208
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:01,552
[ED] No...!
It can't be...

209
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:07,062
[PRIDE] Ah,
so you can't see, then?

210
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:08,064
That's good...

211
00:15:08,524 --> 00:15:09,860
We've found your abilities

212
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,239
to be quite problematic
in the past...

213
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:13,743
You're by far the
most troublesome

214
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:16,080
of the State Alchemists
we've dealt with.

215
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,878
[PRIDE]
I think it's fair to say,

216
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:20,172
you've had this coming.

217
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:23,178
[ED] Colonel...
you performed it...?

218
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:26,977
Human transmutation?

219
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:29,983
[ROY] Of course not...

220
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:33,991
You think I would
willingly do such a thing?

221
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:38,291
[PRIDE]
That's true, he didn't...

222
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,089
We had to force him
to open the portal.

223
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,220
[PRIDE] It all
worked out in the end...

224
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,556
Now Colonel Mustang's meddling

225
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,894
and his troublesome flame
alchemy will present...

226
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:49,564
no more problems for us...

227
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,739
[FATHER] The truth can
be such a cruel thing...

228
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:55,367
The two brothers
who wanted to feel

229
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,037
their mother's
warmth once more...

230
00:15:57,496 --> 00:15:59,458
their attempt to bring
the dead back to life

231
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,713
cost one of them the
leg on which he stood,

232
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:04,468
as well as the only
family he had left...

233
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,517
[FATHER] The other
lost his entire body,

234
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:09,604
to have it replaced
by a suit of armor

235
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:10,940
that could feel nothing.

236
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,571
The woman who
sought to bring back

237
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:16,702
her only baby
was given a body

238
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:18,539
and then...

239
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:20,751
the man who looked
to change his nation

240
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,755
had his eyesight
taken from him...

241
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:26,179
and now he can no
longer see his future.

242
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:28,767
[FATHER] Humans who
would dare to play god

243
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:31,439
must pay a steep price
for their arrogance...

244
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:34,069
That is the way
of the universe,

245
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:35,405
the natural
order imposed

246
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:38,453
by the very thing
you claim to worship...

247
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:39,455
That is Truth.

248
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,336
[ED]
I don't think so!

249
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:51,897
[ED] If he'd done it of
his own volition like we did,

250
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:53,567
that would be one thing.

251
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:54,945
But...

252
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,531
to force someone
to participate

253
00:16:56,531 --> 00:16:58,535
in human transmutation
against his will

254
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,040
and then steal
his eyesight?!

255
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:02,585
You think that's justified?!

256
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:06,593
That isn't a truth that
I'm willing to accept!

257
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:18,449
[BRADLEY] You plan to
interfere with Father's plans?

258
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,333
[BRADLEY] Tell me...
You go by Scar.

259
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,128
What's your real name?

260
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:47,675
[SCAR]
I have none.

261
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:53,102
[SCAR]
I left it.

262
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,943
[BRADLEY]
You don't say...

263
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:57,987
What a coincidence...

264
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:01,077
I don't know what my
real name is either.

265
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:03,957
[BRADLEY]
It's almost poetic...

266
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,963
two nameless men
fighting to the death.

267
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:36,690
[ED]
May Chang!

268
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:38,986
[MAY CHANG]
There he is!

269
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:40,614
[FATHER] And now
my lovely home

270
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:42,618
has a gaping hole in it...

271
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:44,288
How dare you, girl.

272
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:45,750
[MAY CHANG]
He may look different now,

273
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,419
but there's no
mistaking it...

274
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:50,467
he's the one who's
behind all of this!

275
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:52,262
[MAY CHANG]
Oh, Alphonse!

276
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:53,599
What happened to you?

277
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:55,561
[ED]
I don't know...

278
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:57,272
I can't get him to wake up.

279
00:18:57,272 --> 00:18:58,609
[MAY CHANG]
Oh, no!

280
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:00,028
Please wake up,
Alphonse...!

281
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:02,658
Come on you have to!

282
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,706
Come on, Alphonse, get up!

283
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:21,278
[AL]
My body...

284
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,832
[AL]
That's... my body.

285
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:40,441
[AL (human)]
I've waited a long time.

286
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,542
[AL (human)]
Welcome home, Al.

287
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:03,487
[AL]
Your arms...

288
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,576
You've grown so thin...

289
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,830
Nothing but skin and bones.

290
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,255
It's all you can do just
to stand up... I can't...

291
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:14,886
I can't...

292
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:19,812
[AL] I can't fight
in a body like this...

293
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:22,192
but everyone
else is fighting!

294
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:26,033
[AL (human)] You don't want
to become one with me again?

295
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:27,703
[AL]
No, it's not that!

296
00:20:28,371 --> 00:20:31,377
For a long... long time
all I've thought about

297
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:34,132
is getting my body
back... and yet...

298
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,684
I can't come back to you...

299
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,355
I just can't right now...

300
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:45,113
That body isn't
strong enough.

301
00:20:47,283 --> 00:20:49,956
[AL (human)]
You want to go back there.

302
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:52,503
You want to go
back in that body?

303
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:59,642
[AL (human)]
Then I won't stop you.

304
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,545
[AL]
I'm sorry...! I'll be back...!

305
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:37,425
Just wait a little longer!

306
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:40,056
I swear I'll be back...!

307
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:43,647
I promise...! I promise!

308
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:49,867
[ED]
Al!

309
00:21:51,203 --> 00:21:52,790
[ED]
Al! Are you all right?

310
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,708
[MAY CHANG]
Alphonse!

311
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,710
[IZUMI]
Al!

312
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,132
[AL]
Teacher... Brother...

313
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:01,014
May... Then we're--?

314
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:07,110
[AL (human)] He left behind
the body he had searched for

315
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,116
for so long to go
and help his friends.

316
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:13,205
My valiant, noble soul...
as your vessel,

317
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,838
I am very proud of you... but...

318
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:20,094
With your selfless return...

319
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:24,269
the world may be plunged
into darkness and despair.

320
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:27,108
My Alphonse.

321
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:32,828
[FATHER]
And now... all five are here.

322
00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:06,974
<i>[NARRATOR]
Courage can be brought</i>

323
00:24:06,974 --> 00:24:08,978
<i>to its knees by
unremitting force...</i>

324
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:12,736
<i>And happiness can easily
be shattered into pieces.</i>

325
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:16,911
<i>Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood,</i>

326
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,712
<i>Episode 60: "Eye of Heaven,
Gateway of Earth."</i>

327
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:27,014
<i>And before long...</i>

328
00:24:28,016 --> 00:24:30,438
<i>the world is
shrouded in darkness.</i>
