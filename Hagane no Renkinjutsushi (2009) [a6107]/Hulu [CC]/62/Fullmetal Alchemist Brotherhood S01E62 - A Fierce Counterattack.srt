00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:42,457
[BRIGGS SOLDIER 2]
Let's get him!

00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:55,122
[screams]

3
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:56,990
[crash]

4
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,023
[FATHER]
Hmm?

5
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:01,190
[gasping]

6
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,890
[HOHENHEIM] I won't let
you devour any more people.

7
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:14,123
[AL]
Dad!

8
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:15,357
[HOHENHEIM] He was
hoping to use them

9
00:02:15,357 --> 00:02:17,823
to create another
Philosopher's Stone.

10
00:02:18,523 --> 00:02:20,190
[FATHER] What else
are all these pitiful,

11
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,990
powerless humans good for?

12
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:24,990
[HOHENHEIM] You insist
on treating humans

13
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,523
as a lower life form,
but don't you see?

14
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,890
Only through them can a
Philosopher's Stone be created,

15
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,857
and only through a Stone
can a Homunculus arise.

16
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:36,190
But what does a
Homunculus produce...?

17
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,123
What do you create?

18
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:38,957
[HOHENHEIM]
Creation is all,

19
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:41,857
and you've done
nothing but destroy.

20
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,123
[HOHENHEIM] You may
think you've reached

21
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:44,890
a perfect state of being...

22
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,690
but in truth,

23
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,890
all you've reached
is a dead end!

24
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,523
[FATHER]
I can create...

25
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:53,023
Shall I produce
some humans for you?

26
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:08,166
[anguished moans]

27
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:19,510
[gasp]

28
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,410
[KING XERXES] At last
I've found immortality...

29
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,577
Don't you see...?

30
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:26,810
I am... still alive.

31
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,810
[HOHENHEIM]
King Xerxes, is that you?!

32
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,377
[gasp]

33
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:40,443
[baby cries]

34
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:44,510
[GIRL 1]
A body...!

35
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,943
[BOY 1]
I have a body again!

36
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:46,610
[BOY 2]
Finally...

37
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,443
[AL] No...
No, stop this!

38
00:03:49,443 --> 00:03:52,543
It isn't...
it isn't right!

39
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:54,943
[MAN 1]
Look...! Bodies!

40
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,610
[OLD MAN 1]
Hohenheim...

41
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,943
[HOHENHEIM]
This is wrong.

42
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,643
[HOHENHEIM]
Damn you...!

43
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:13,177
[HOHENHEIM]
No!

44
00:04:14,343 --> 00:04:18,810
[rumbling blast]

45
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,277
[CARLY] What is this?
What's happening?

46
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:24,643
[crashes]

47
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:25,810
[GREED]
Damn it!

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,543

00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,677
[DARIUS]
You all right?

51
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:31,310
[GREED] Perfect...
Now how 'bout a lift...

52
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,410
You could use
someone who knows

53
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,243
what's going on, right?

54
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:35,277
[DARIUS]
That's true...

55
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:36,777
What the hell is happening?

56
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,977
[GREED]
Oh, not much--

57
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,710
the Father of the Homunculi
is going berserk out there!

58
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,610
So let's go...

59
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,243
we'll need anyone
who can still fight.

60
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,510
You...!

61
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,543
The fat frog-man
and the two women...

62
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:50,410
Get down... You're injured.

63
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,410
[OLIVIER]
Absolutely not...!

64
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,343
I still have forces who
need me to lead them!

65
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:55,310
[GREED]
Forget that...!

66
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,577
Get down here now...!

67
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:59,610
This is no time for a pissing
contest over who's in charge.

68
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,710
[OLIVIER] I'm not
taking orders from--

69
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,343
[BLISS]
General!

70
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,377
[BLISS] A message
from headquarters, sir.

71
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:07,477
[OLIVIER]
Operations... it's me...

72
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:09,643
What's happening?

73
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,877
[CARLY] General.... it's
the Central Command Center...

74
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:16,810
Half of it's been blown up!

75
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,977
[ARMSTRONG]
Blown up?

76
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:20,377
[CARLY] We can't
contact the north gate.

77
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:24,577
[GREED] You see
the power he has?

78
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:28,543
[ARMSTRONG]
What sort of monster is he?!

79
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:31,277
[GREED] He appears
to be an ordinary man.

80
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,810
However... within him
is a Philosopher's Stone

81
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,977
powered by many
thousands of people...

82
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:37,677
You could say
he's used its energy

83
00:05:37,677 --> 00:05:40,943
to claim the powers
of God for himself.

84
00:05:40,943 --> 00:05:41,877
[GREED]
As alchemists,

85
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:44,677
you understand the
trouble this presents?

86
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,477
[ARMSTRONG]
All too well.

87
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:49,810
[GREED] Any ordinary
human should leave now.

88
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,410
[OLIVIER] My men
are still fighting...

89
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,777
I will not just
abandon my forces...

00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:56,810

It's Headquarters again, sir.

93
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:07,843
[CARLY]
Don't worry about us, sir.

94
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:09,677
Have you forgotten
who we are...?

95
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:11,943
We Briggs soldiers are
trained to respond instantly

96
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:15,343

threat... even without you.

00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:20,643
What's your status?

101
00:06:20,643 --> 00:06:23,343
[CARLY] From what I hear,
you've been injured, General...

102
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:26,377
Please... stay and
wait where you are.

103
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:30,343
[OLIVIER]
Listen up, Alex!

104
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:31,443
[ARMSTRONG]
Yes?

105
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,510
[OLIVIER]
Take the radio with you.

106
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,777
[OLIVIER]
Win at any cost.

107
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:39,777
[ARMSTRONG]
Well, of course!

108
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:42,243
[ROY] Right...
let's move, Hawkeye.

109
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:43,277
[GREED] Hold on...

110
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,310
you two aren't in any
shape to fight, either.

111
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,410
[ROY] I am
going to burn up

112
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,843
that Philosopher's
Stone of his...

113
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:51,710
I'll need the lieutenant's
help in order to do so.

114
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:56,577
[DARIUS] Let it go...
Now... Let's move...

115
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:58,243
[LAN FAN] Right...
I'm coming too.

116
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,377
It is my job to
protect the young lord.

117
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,843
[SIG] Take care... and
keep them safe, friend.

118
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,443
[ARMSTRONG]
Brace yourselves...!

119
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:16,577
Now we continue
our rise to glory!

120
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:41,277
[OLIVIER] So this is
where you met your end...

121
00:07:41,277 --> 00:07:43,210
And was it you
that killed him?

122
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,577
[SCAR]
When he arrived here...

123
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:47,477
he was already badly injured...

124
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:51,443
If it hadn't been for those
wounds, I might have lost.

125
00:07:51,443 --> 00:07:52,910
[BLISS]
Captain Buccaneer...

126
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,310
He was working with
soldiers from Xing...

127
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,677
He inflicted a mortal
wound on Bradley.

128
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,977
[OLIVIER] Like I always
told you, Bradley...

129
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:09,710
Briggs men are as
tough as they come.

Oh, Shao May...

Because of Mr. Hohenheim...

145
00:09:45,277 --> 00:09:47,610
He got to me at
the last second.

Stop it...!

00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,510
Leave them alone!

[CARLY] Your target is the man
with the long blonde hair...

156
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,877
Make sure you don't
shoot Fullmetal by mistake!

157
00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:37,543
[BRIGGS SOLDIERS]
Right!

158
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:39,743

Hey, Fullmetal... Are you okay?

166
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,477
[ED] It's bad...!
He didn't even flinch!

167
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:14,910

Seriously?!

Yes, sir!

That bastard's not
even breaking a sweat!

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,677
[CARLY] Copy that...
Put me through.

176
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:42,310
[BRIGGS CAPTAIN] Right...
If you're sure, sir.

177
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,310
Take cover, men...! Now!

178
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,643
[explosion]

179
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,810

181
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:19,872
[ROY]
So did I hit him?

182
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,939
[HAWKEYE] You were off
just a little bit...

183
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,406
Adjust it to
twelve o'clock.

184
00:12:23,406 --> 00:12:25,039
[clap]

185
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,272
[ROY] I can't tell how
much to throttle the flames.

186
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:29,372
[HAWKEYE] You don't
have to throttle them...!

187
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:32,272
Range fifty....no, fifty-three.

188
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:35,472
This clapping transmutation
doesn't feel natural.

189

190
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:45,339
[HAWKEYE] Incoming attack,
Colonel, dead ahead!

191

192
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:49,306
[HAWKEYE] Nicely done.

193
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:52,839
[ROY] I'll say... this
could turn out to be handy.

194
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:53,972
[BRIGGS CAPTAIN]
Fire now!

195
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,472
Keep firing!

196
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:57,139
[ARMSTRONG]

198
00:12:57,972 --> 00:13:01,239

Rrrraaaagggh!!

202
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:29,039
[GREED] Hahaha! Amazing!
If I had power like that...

203
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,172
then this entire world
would be mine in no time!

204
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:34,239
[LING]
Hey, Greed.

205
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:35,339
[LING]
You've always talked about

206
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,206
wanting the entire world,

207
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:38,772
but is this really
what you meant?

208
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:39,806
[GREED]
Oh, yes...

209
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:41,406
Once I have this
supreme power,

210
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:44,506
everything in the
world will be mine.

211
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:45,506
Who knows,

212
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,939
maybe it will fill the
emptiness inside me...

213
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,039
An achievement like that

214
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,006
could finally quench the
thirst that I've lived with

215
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:52,806
since the day I was born!

216
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:54,439
[LING]
How ignorant you are...

217
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:59,106
What you're seeking is
not what you truly want.

218
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:02,072
[GREED] Keep quiet
you little pest.

219
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:04,772
I am Greed
the Avaricious...!

220
00:14:04,772 --> 00:14:07,006
I want everything!

221
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:14,439

223
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:27,106
[ARMSTRONG]
No effect at all.

224
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:32,006
[ARMSTRONG] We have to find
a way through his defenses.

225
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:32,806
[BRIGGS CAPTAIN]
Come in...!

226
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,272
We need more ammo.

227
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:36,072
[FATHER]
What a futile battle...

228
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,972
You poor, helpless
humans can't hope

229
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:40,139
to lay so much
as a finger on me.

230
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:44,506
[GREED]
Maybe humans aren't able...

231
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:46,972
But what about a Homunculus?

232
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,972
[GREED] Wonderful--you're
just in time, Greed...

233
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:55,172
What a dutiful
son you are...

234
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:59,939
As it happens, I could use
another Philosopher's Stone.

235
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:01,972

I'll be taking yours.

Good acting, right?

238
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:17,072

take my Stone from me

your own barrier...

00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:19,872
Stupid fool...

I bet you never
thought your godly powers

242
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:23,972
could be taken away, did you?

00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:27,972

But you were wrong...

244
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:29,739

00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:26,906
[FATHER]
Hurrrghh!

250
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,306
[HOHENHEIM]
He's losing control.

251
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:33,406
[HOHENHEIM] He can't
keep the power of God

252
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:36,039
he claims to have
in check anymore.

I need a favor.

Back then, Ed was
willing to sacrifice

269
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:19,558
his right arm in order
to bring my soul back.

270
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,625

[MAY CHANG] Alphonse,
what are you saying?

00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,558
[AL] All you have
