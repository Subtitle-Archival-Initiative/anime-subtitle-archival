00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,703

No doubt about it.

[Ed] But somehow he's ignoring
the law of equivalent exchange.

64
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:14,803
[Al] And he's changing organic
matter into inorganic matter...

65
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,270
He shouldn't be able
to do that, unless...

66
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,170
[Ed] Yeah, there's
just one way...

[Edward] Huh... so this
is the almighty Leto?

72
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,337
[Rose] Welcome. Are you
interested in Letoism?

73
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:46,303
Nope, can't say I am - not
really the "religious" type.

74
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:49,503
Well, I'm sorry to hear
that... To know God is...

75
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:53,237
...to know hope. If we
believe in divine grace...

76
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:55,470
Then through him all
things are possible.

00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,303
If you believed--

78
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:59,570
I'm sure Leto would bless you
and make you grow taller!

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,237

supposed to mean?!

[Alphonse] Easy, brother.
She's just trying to help...

81
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,503
[Ed] What about bringing
the dead back to life?

82
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:09,370
Do you believe
that's possible, too?

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,937
Yes.

the average adult...

92
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:38,660
It's been calculated to the
last microgram, but still...

93
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,227
there's never been
one reported case

94
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:42,894
of successfully
creating a human life.

95
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:45,627
And you're telling me something
modern science can't do,

96
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:46,760
you can do with prayer?!

97
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,827

faithful shall be answered!"

Did I mention, all those
ingredients I read off...

100
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,160
Down at the market, a kid
could buy every one of them

101
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
for the spare change
in his pocket.

102
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,027
As it turns out,
humans are pretty cheap.

103
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,027
No, that's blasphemy!
People are--

104
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:07,094
We're all children of God...
created in his image!

105
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:11,894
Heh. You have to understand,
alchemists are scientists.

106
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:15,827
We don't believe in unprovable
concepts like creators or gods.

107
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:18,360
We observe the physical laws
that govern this world

108
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,160
to try and
learn the truth.

109
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
It's ironic, really.

110
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,060
That through the
application of science,

111
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,094
we have in many ways
been given the power

112
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,694
to play gods ourselves...

113
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:30,094
So you're putting yourself
on the same level as God?

114
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:32,394
That's just-- sheer arrogance!

115
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:34,227
[Ed] You know,
there's an old myth--

116
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,227
about a hero who
flew on wings made of wax.

117
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:40,127
He thought he could touch the
sun, but when he got too close,

118
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,627
his wings melted, and he came
crashing back down to earth...

119
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:45,060
Right Al?

120
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,860
[Al] Brother...

121
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,394
[Ed] I'm sorry, miss...
This is difficult for me to ask,

122
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:51,027
but do you think
your Father Cornello

123
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:53,927
could even save an
arrogant scientist like me?

124
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,760
Of course! That's wonderful!

125
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,327
If anyone can lead you to
the creator's light, he can!

00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,918
A child, and a man
wearing a suit of armor...

129
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,684
They would only give their
names as "the Elric brothers."

130
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:12,284
I can't be bothered now.
Just send them away.

131
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:13,351
Wait, "the Elrics"?

132
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,584
You're sure that's what
they said. You're positive.

133
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:18,084
Yes, Father. That's what they
called themselves, no mistake.

134
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,984
Damn... then this
is a problem...

135

Edward Elric, the
Fullmetal Alchemist,

136
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,184

137
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,051
That's him?
The man in the armor?

138
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:27,084
Hmm. Dressing the part,
it would seem.

139
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:29,951
But, why would a State
Alchemist be here in Liore?

140
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,784
Surely they can't have found
out about our plans...

141
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,218
[Cornello] It's possible
this dog's nose

142
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:36,251
is too sharp for his own good.

143
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:41,181
<i>[Cray] This way, please.
Father Cornello is a busy man,</i>

144
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:43,714
<i>as you can imagine.
But you're in luck.</i>

145
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,981
<i>He's decided to spare
a moment for you.</i>

146
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:47,914
Yeah, thanks.
We understand.

147
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,381
We won't take too
much of his time.

148
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:52,981
Good, then it's agreed.
We'll make this quick.

149
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:57,814
Brother Cray, what is this?
What do you think you're doing?

150
00:07:57,814 --> 00:08:00,114
[Cray] Rose, these heathens
have come to ensnare

151
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:02,214
and discredit the
Father. They're evil.

152
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:03,248
This is God's will!

153
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:04,681
Brother Cray...

154
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:07,381
Well, like you said.
Let's make this quick!

155
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:18,381
Oh yeah! Strike!

00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:24,314
Ah, the Fullmetal Alchemist.

00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:27,014
Welcome to the home
of our sacred order.

159
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:28,214
Father Cornello!

160
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:31,214
[Cornello] I must apologize
for my disciples' behavior.

161
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:33,181
It would seem they've
been misguided...

162
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:35,081
[Ed] Okay, let's say I
believe you weren't the one

163
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,948
guiding them. What next?

164
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,948
Have you come to learn
the ways of Leto?

165
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:41,148
Well, there are a few things
I'm curious about...

166
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:43,148
Like how you've been
using second rate alchemy

167
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,448
to deceive your followers.

168
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:47,714
My dear boy, I don't
know what you mean.

169
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:49,348
What your doubting
eyes see as alchemy

170
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:51,948
are the miracles of
the Sun God Leto.

171
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,081
Look again. Could
mere alchemy create

172
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,814
something from
nothing in this way?

173
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:56,781
[gasp]

174
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:59,048
[Ed] Yeah, that's what
I didn't get at first...

175
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,081
How can you perform transmutations

176
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,148
that ignore the law of
equivalent exchange?

177
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:05,781
As I said,
because it isn't alchemy!

178
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,814
But then I started
thinking about it...

179
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,214
If you'd somehow managed to
acquire a certain object

180
00:09:10,214 --> 00:09:11,848
to amplify your alchemy...

181
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:14,948
one that's said to make
the impossible possible.

182
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:16,814
That would
explain everything.

183
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:17,781
What...?

184
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:20,681
[Ed] I'm talking about
the Philosopher's Stone.

185
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:23,114

That's it, isn't it?

186
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:26,348

I derive my power.

sell that line, huh?

191
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,081
If that's the way
you want to play it,

192
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:36,281
I guess I'll have
to come up there

193
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:37,981

199
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:54,714
Now child, I want you to
shoot the Fullmetal Alchemist.

200
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:58,248
No, I-- Father,
I can't do that!

chosen emissary...

202

of Leto himself!

203
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:06,914
Shoot him rose.
It's God's will.

That's right...

211
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:25,881

and led you into God's light.

212

And do you remember recall what
it was I promised you then?

You said if I had faith,
you'd bring him back to life!

00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:20,915
It won't be easy. We might
even get killed along the way.

339
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:25,548
But that's the path we chose...
All we can do is keep moving.

340
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:29,581
[Rose] But... Father
Cornello said...

341
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:31,581
He said he could do
it. He promised me...

342
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:33,148
Just because you and
your brother failed,

343
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:34,548
that doesn't mean--

344
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:36,581
It doesn't mean he will!

345
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,515
[running footsteps]

346
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:41,181
There you are,
you infernal brat!

347
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,815
Look, can we just cut
the crap and talk here?

348
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:47,581
All I want are some straight
answers about the Stone.

349
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:50,448
Tell me what I need to know
and I'll be on my way...

350
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:52,181
...or we could get
the military involved...

351
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:53,815
[angry grunt]

352
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:56,848
Ask your questions.

353
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:59,681
You could do anything with
the Philosopher's Stone, right?

354
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:03,048
So why waste all of that power
performing phony "miracles"?

355
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,681
Because with each miracle,

356
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:07,681
I can attract new
believers to the order,

357
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:10,548
believers who would lay down
their lives for my sake.

358
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:12,215
I'm slowly building an army!

359
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:15,515
A legion of holy warriors,
unafraid to die!

360
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:16,781
In a few more more years,

361
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:19,715
I'll be ready to unleash this
mindless horde upon the world!

362
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:23,481
And I'll use the Philosopher's
Stone to tear this country apart

363
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:26,715
Who knows? I might even carve
you out a slice for you!

364
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:28,615
[evil laughter]

365
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:29,681
[childish laughter]

366
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,648
Wait, what are you
laughing about?

367
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:34,948
I knew it. You really
are a novice, aren't you?

368
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:44,815
[Cornello echoing]
You don't mean that--!

369
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,581
[Al] There were never
any miracles, Rose...

370
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:50,181
He lied to you.
He lied to everyone.

371
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:52,515
[Cornello echoing]
<i>Why you...!</i>

372
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:53,548
[Cornello through speakers]
<i>How long?!</i>

373
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:55,181
<i>How long has that been on?!</i>

374
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:56,081
[Edward through speakers]
<i>From the start.</i>

375
00:17:56,081 --> 00:17:58,548
<i>Your "believers"
heard every word.</i>

376
00:17:58,548 --> 00:18:00,548
[Cornello] <i>How could you?!</i>

377
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:02,215
You'll pay dearly for this!

378
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,681
[magical ringing]

379
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,115
Sorry... Not today!

380
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:09,581
[Ed] Just face it...
you're outclassed here.

381
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,748
I am without rival!

382
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:17,181
[magical laser lightning]

383
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:20,748
[explosion]

384
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:23,115
[gasping in pain]
ughh ukggg uh

385
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:24,881
It-It's a rebound!

386
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:27,715
No! I won't be
disgraced like this!

387
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:30,215
Now, boy... Behold...

388
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:34,548
...the chosen emissary
of the Sun God Leto!

389
00:18:38,748 --> 00:18:40,748
[explosion]

390
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:50,181
[ground being crushed]

391
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:53,615
[Ed wincing in pain]

392
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:56,715
My word is the divine
word of god himself!

393
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:59,881
My fist is the almighty
fist of judgment!

394
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:02,581
Oh, yeah?
The fist of god, huh?

395
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:06,748
Well if that's what
you want, you can have it!

396
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:09,181
[magic electricity]

397
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:15,815
[yelling]
OUGHAAAAAAAH!

398
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:28,648
Shut up! Just give me
the Philosopher's Stone!

399
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:37,181
What the hell? The stone...

400
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:39,515
It's supposed to be
perfect material!

401
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:41,815
How did it just
break like that?!

402
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:44,181
[Cornello] I don't know!
I don't know anything about it!

403
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:47,915
Spare me! Please! I-I was
wrong! Please! I beg you!

404
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:49,048
It's a damn fake.

405
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:51,715
[Cornello] Please don't.
I'm helpless without the stone.

406
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:53,081
Spare me, please!

407
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:54,781
You mean, we went
through all this...

408
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:57,681
risked our lives just for
this one possible chance...

409
00:19:57,681 --> 00:20:00,081
...and it's a fake.

410
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:02,981
So, uh...
What about me?

411
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:06,681
I don't care what you do!
Just get outta here!

412
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,448
Right!

413
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:12,215
[Alphonse] <i>And what
about the Stone?</i>

414
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:14,848
[Edward] <i>A phony.
Just like him.</i>

415
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:15,881
[Al] <i>Oh.</i>

416
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,281
I'm sorry, Al.
For a while there,

417
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:21,448
I thought we'd really found
a way to get your body back.

418
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:23,481
[Rose] Give me the
Philosopher's Stone!

419
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:26,215
[Al] Rose...

420
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:27,981
Like I was
just saying...

421
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:30,081
It was a fake.
It wasn't real.

422
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:32,081
And besides,
it's shattered now...

423
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,981
Liar!... You want to keep it
for yourself, don't you?!

424
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:37,748
So you can use it on your
bodies... that's right!

425
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:40,181
And so you can try to bring
your mother back again!

426
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:41,815
You shut up!

427
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:46,581
People don't come back from
the dead, Rose. Not ever...

428
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,948
Not ever...

429
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:54,115
[Rose] But he promised me...

430
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:58,148
He said if I prayed,
it would happen. A miracle...

431
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:02,081
That hope was all I had left!

432
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:04,648
What am I supposed
to believe in now?!

433
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:09,181
Tell me what to do... please...

434
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:14,448
I can't tell you that.
You have to figure it out.

435
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:20,615
[Ed] Stand up and walk...
Keep moving forward...

436
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:23,648
You've got two good
legs. So use them...

437
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:27,648
You're strong enough
to make your own path.

438
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:35,581
[angry mob yelling]
Bring him out here!

439
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:43,681
That damn brat.
It's all ruined--

440
00:21:43,681 --> 00:21:44,648
everything I've worked for...!

441
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:47,215
[Lust] Yes, all that
hard work for nothing.

442
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:50,815
I knew we should have just
incited a little rebellion.

443
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,048
[Cornello] You--!

444
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:54,048
I'm hungry, Lust.
Can I eat the old man?

445
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,881
Please? He's big and fat.

446
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,548
Not this one, Gluttony...

447
00:21:57,548 --> 00:22:00,515
We don't want you giving
yourself indigestion.

448
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:03,581
Now you, too?! Everyone is
mocking me! I won't stand fo--

449
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:04,848
[stabbing]

450
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:06,481
[Cornello] Urrgghhhuh

451
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:11,648
[Lust] I'd say this
concludes our business.

452
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:18,715
Just as things were beginning
to look promising, too...

453
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:21,981
Now I suppose we'll have to
start over from scratch...

454
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:25,481
[Lust] Father won't be
pleased. In any case,

455
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:28,515
it's time we started
thinking about our next move.

456
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:31,848
