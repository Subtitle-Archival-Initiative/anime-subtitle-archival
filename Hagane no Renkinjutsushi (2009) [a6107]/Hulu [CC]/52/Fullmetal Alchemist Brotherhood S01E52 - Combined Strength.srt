1
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:39,550
A Philosopher's Stone!

2
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,517
But where did he find one?!

3
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,890
Dust in our eyes? Again?

4
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,190
[Al] Hwa!

5
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,324
[Kimblee] Hya!

6
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:55,024
[Al grunts]

7
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:56,790
[Al yelps]

8
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,224
[Selim and Al grunt]

9
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,457
[Al grunts]

10
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,890
[Kimblee] Hmph!

11
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:19,224
[Al gasps]

12
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,857
[Selim startles]

13
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:32,957
I won't fall for that again!

14
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,090
A Flash bomb!

15
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,757
[Al] A decoy!

16
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,490
That's the stone...
A tricky thing!

17
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,124
[Al exhales]

18
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:04,890
[Kimblee] Yes, The power of
the Philosopher's Stone...

19
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,924
is truly something to behold...
Having used one myself,

20
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:12,290
I suppose I know that
better than anyone.

21
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,190
That's why I'm puzzled by you.

22
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,124
What I'd like to know is
why you don't use that power

23
00:03:18,124 --> 00:03:22,957
to get your original body back.

24
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:24,290
With the stone in hand,

25
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,057
you wouldn't have any
trouble fleeing from us...

26
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:29,924
And once you had gotten
away, you and your brother

27
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:32,924
could use the stone to
restore your bodies...

28
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:36,124
and then your journey
would end, wouldn't it?

29
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:38,924
[Al] If I did that,
I couldn't save everyone.

30
00:03:38,924 --> 00:03:41,757
It's in accordance
with your ideals...

31
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:44,024
In order to obtain something...

32
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,224
you give up something
of equal value.

33
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:48,957
[Al] Tell me...

34
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:52,357
Why do I have to choose?

35
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,890
It isn't right...
I have to choose between

36
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,057
returning to our original
bodies and saving everyone.

37
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:04,157
But why can't we have
our real bodies back

38
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:07,957
and save everyone?
It isn't fair!

39
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:14,824
But it's the law of
equivalent exchange.

40
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,924
Well, I say searching
for possibilities

41
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,190
that aren't bound
by rules or laws--

42
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,190
that's how humanity advances.

43
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,357
I see... so if you can discover

44
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:27,324
an exception to the rule,
you can effectively

45
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:30,424
rewrite the laws of nature
as we understand them.

46
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:33,157
Is that how it's
supposed to go?

47
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:40,090
Because there is another
possibility, you know...

48
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,057
You don't get
your bodies back...

49
00:04:42,057 --> 00:04:44,524
And you don't save everyone...

50
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:47,324
That could certainly happen.

51
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,224
[Al gasps]

52
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,190
[Sloth grunts]

53
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,457
[Armstrong]
I'm not finished yet!

54
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:04,890
[Armstrong grunts]

55
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,224
[Sloth groans]

56
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:11,024
[Olivier yells]

57
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:13,957
[Sloth groans]

58
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,857
Good! He has weak spots!

59
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:22,124
[Sloth groans]

60
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:28,857
Ow... I'm dying...
I hate dying.

61
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:32,757
It's such... a pain.

62
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:36,957
Ahh... Coming back
is a pain...

63
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:43,324
But then... fighting all-out...
is the biggest pain of all...

64
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:44,990
Say what?

65
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:50,524
All right, General Armstrong!
Throw down your weapon.

66
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:54,224
[Soldier] What the... What
the hell is that huge thing?!

67
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:56,957
[Sloth groans]

68
00:06:08,857 --> 00:06:11,290
What was that?

69
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,057
[Sloth] Looks like... I missed.

70
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:19,357
[Olivier braces, gasps]

71
00:06:22,357 --> 00:06:25,324
He's fast! What
incredible speed!

72
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:28,057
Sloth the Indolent, indeed!

73
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:30,290
Olivier!

74
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,190
[Olivier] It's just a
scratch. Just then...

75
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,124
Did you see what he did?

76
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:37,490
[Armstrong] Only the
blur... For him to have

77
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,090
that kind of speed,
at his size. It's just--

78
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,024
I know... it keeps
getting better.

79
00:06:43,024 --> 00:06:48,990
Yes... I am... the fastest
Homunculus of them all.

80
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:52,757
[Armstrong yells]

81
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:53,857
Are you all right?

82
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:55,457
[Armstrong grunts]

83
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:59,390
[Olivier] Luckily, he's too
fast to control his movements.

84
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:02,990
No!

85
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:10,157
Finally... I hit you.

86
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:21,890
Mmm... I love that sound...

87
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,324
There's nothing more beautiful

88
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:25,190
than the sound of
two strong souls

89
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,957
colliding against
each other in battle...

90
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:35,124
I assure you, Alphonse Elric
is still close by.

91
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:37,324
Indeed, I think he is.

92
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,757
It will take more
than that to kill him.

93
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,124
[sound of a stone
hitting metal]

94
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:49,024
There you are!

95
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,424
[Al grunts]

96
00:07:56,024 --> 00:08:01,190
That trick? Again? How
artless... It won't work.

97
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:10,224
[Al shrieks]

98
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:13,924
Remember, I can tell
where you are by smell...

99
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:16,324
I think that's checkmate.

100
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:18,190
[Al] Are you sure?

101
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,757
I still think you're giving
us humans too little credit.

102
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:23,324
[Selim scoffs]

103
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:25,324
[Al grunts]

104
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:27,257
[Selim] Even with the
stone, there's no way

105
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,024
you'll win this
all by yourself.

106
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:31,090
[Al] I'm not alone!

107
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:35,390
Where did the stone go?

108
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,890
[Selim] <i>Can it be...?</i>

109
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,390
<i>The purpose of this dust cloud</i>

110
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,824
<i>was to let him know the
direction of the wind?</i>

111
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:49,990
<i>It must be. He's set
something downwind</i>

112
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,490
<i>where my sense of
smell won't work.</i>

113
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,757
[Kimblee] It's an
attack from behind!

114
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:09,357
[Kimblee] <i>Impossible! How could
he move with those injuries?</i>

115
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:14,224
[Kimblee gasps]

116
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:16,490
[Kimblee] Doctor Marcoh...!

117
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,490
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

118
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:29,915
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

119
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,515
[Central Soldier 3] They said it
was an ice cream truck, right?

120
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:38,115
That's right... So keep
your eyes sharp.

121
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:41,049
This alchemy stuff--
it really is handy, isn't it?

122
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:42,582
It wasn't very difficult for me

123
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,949
to change up the
truck's appearance.

124
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,715
[Ross] We can't
get in here either...

125
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:56,682
North, south, east, west...
the gates are all closed.

126
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:59,882
[Hawkeye] What do we do now?
Force our way in?

127
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:02,049
No... We'll leave
that to the others...

128
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,882
The Briggs soldiers
can handle that route...

129
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:07,049
We're gonna take
a more subtle one.

130
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,715
Sir?

131
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:12,415
We're splitting up here...
You two take them...

132
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:14,115
Head for "you-know-where."

133
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,415
Yes, sir.

134
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:19,649
[Dummies growl]

135
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:20,649
[Zampano roars]

136
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:23,015
[Dummies scream]

137
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:26,482
[Darius grunts]

138
00:10:26,482 --> 00:10:27,782
[Darius] Hm?

139
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:30,549
[Ed yells]

140
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:34,082
A good thing I'm so beefy.

141
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:37,382
[Dummies moan]

142
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:39,382
I guess that shows you
what a Philosopher's Stone

143
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:41,515
can do for you, huh?

144
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:47,915
The legs! Go for the legs!

145
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,549
[Zampano pants]

146
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,149
[Gerso gurgles]

147
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:59,149
[Dummies moan]

148
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,749
[Ed shudders]

149
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:09,449
[Dummies yell]

150
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:11,815
[Ed yells]

151
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:14,049
[Dummies scream]

152
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,049
[Ed grunts]

153
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:21,082
[Ed yells]

154
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:27,482
[Armstrong struggles]

155
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:29,049
[Olivier gasps]

156
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:38,015
[Armstrong and Sloth struggle]

157
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:41,582
[Armstrong yells]

158
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:45,449
[Soldiers gasp]

159
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:46,849
[Central Soldier] What?

160
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:49,382
[Armstrong grunts]

161
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:50,982
Alex?

162
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:55,849
Oh... it's just dislocated...
And how about you?

163
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,582
Heh. A few fractures,
that's all.

164
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:02,815
[Armstrong and Olivier gasp]

165
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:19,915
[Armstrong coughs]

166
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,882
[Armstrong] Hm? Olivier!

167
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:27,682
[Sloth groans]

168
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:31,049
[Armstrong growls]

169
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:35,649
I'm gonna kill you
quickly and then sleep.

170
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,815
[Heinkel roars]

171
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:50,049
[Al] He stopped?

172
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:58,049
[Al] He's reluctant
to endanger Kimblee...

173
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,549
But that's not
like him at all.

174
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,149
I see now.

175
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,815
[Al] Huh?

176
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:08,615
[Selim] You humans
are indeed tenacious...

177
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:12,382
However... You have
no hope of winning.

178
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:18,582
You should know... Our
father is just over there.

179
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:26,582
But of course...
Before we get to that...

180
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:27,982
we're going to have
to do something

181
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:31,015
about your current
situation, aren't we?

182
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:34,949
[Marcoh yells]

183
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:45,582
[Al] Who...?

184
00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:48,649
[Al and Selim grunt]

185
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:55,415
[Yoki cries] I got you!
I really got you!

186
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:56,382
[Al] Yoki?!

187
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:58,915
All right! Way to take
him out, fuzzy lip!

188
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:00,649
[Yoki cries]

189
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:02,715
You're the last one I expected!

190
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:05,382
I'm not gonna let you guys
play hero all by yourselves!

191
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:06,982
I want some glory
of my own, damn it...

192
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:08,682
Do you hear me?!

193
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,582
How 'bout that?
I landed a shot!

194
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:13,382
And it was on the strongest
Homunculus of them all!

195
00:14:13,382 --> 00:14:16,449
I got him big time!

196
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:18,849
Where'd you get the car?

197
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:21,049
[Marcoh] It's the one
Kimblee rode here in.

198
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:24,915
The guys who drove it here
are taking a little time out.

199
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:27,782
Okay! Well done, Dr. Marcoh.

200
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:34,015
Move it! Let's go!

201
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,782
[Yoki shudders]

202
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:51,782
Shut up! Quit
whining and drive!

203
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:55,515
I have no desire to attempt
fighting that monster head-on!

204
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:58,749
Get us to Central on
the double! We need to

205
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:01,082
meet up with Ed and get
rid of this "Father" guy

206
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:03,682
before that thing
can catch up to us.

207
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:15,049
They may well be
tenacious creatures...

208
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,682
but humans are easy to dupe.

209
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:18,782
[Kimblee wheezes]

210
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:19,782
[Selim] Hm?

211
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:23,982
[Kimblee breathes weakly]

212
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:30,449
Oh, that's good... So
you're still alive, then.

213
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:40,695
[Selim] I think that color
suits you very well, don't you?

214
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:44,029
Lions are called the King
of Beasts for a reason...

215
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:47,662
He followed the law that
says the fittest survive.

216
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:49,362
And accordingly,
he was able to bite

217
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,562
right through your windpipe.

218
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:56,662
[Selim] One can be sure...
in this world...

219
00:15:56,662 --> 00:16:00,295
humans are of
little consequence.

220
00:16:00,295 --> 00:16:04,295
[Kimblee coughs and sputters]

221
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:11,308
[Selim] What was it
you were always saying?

222
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:14,775
That you wanted to see which
way the world would choose?

223
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:20,508
And here you are, dying
like a pathetic wreck...

224
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:22,841
It must be humiliating.

225
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,841
[Selim] But don't
worry too much.

226
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:40,675
[Selim] Because you will
continue to live... inside me.

227
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:58,508
[Olivier moans,
breathes weakly]

228
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:01,208
[Olivier] What... What happened?

229
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,841
[Olivier] Alex!

230
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,075
I knew he was going
to come charging in,

231
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,041
so all I had to do
was wait for him.

232
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,741
[Sloth moans]

233
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,941
Olivier, are you able to stand?

234
00:17:23,941 --> 00:17:26,041
[sound of guns cocking]

235
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,075
[Soldiers shudder nervously]

236
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:32,041
By the way... there are orders
to shoot me for being a traitor.

237
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,941
What?! We can't have that!

238
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:37,741
I'll be the one to inherit
the Armstrong household.

239
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:40,775
You can't die until all of
the paperwork is in place!

240
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:43,008
There's nothing to worry
about there. If I die,

241
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:46,508
the entire estate will be passed
along to Colonel Mustang.

242
00:17:46,508 --> 00:17:49,641
You decided that without
consulting the family?!

243
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:51,108
[Olivier] He's still
just barely preferable

244
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:52,908
to a good-for-nothing like you.

245
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:54,508
[Armstrong] So that's
how you treat someone

246
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,575
who just saved your life?!

247
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:01,075
Hey... What is this?

248
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,908
We're under attack?

249
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:10,008
It can't be...
Mustang's soldiers?

250
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,175
[Soldier whimpers]

251
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:16,241
[Soldier screams]

252
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:17,741
[Soldiers gasp]

253
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:21,108
[Soldier screams,
Dummy growls]

254
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:27,808
[Dummies hiss, moan]

255
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,841
[Dummy growls]

256
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:41,941
[Soldiers murmur]

257
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:47,975
[Soldier 8] What
are those things?!

258
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:50,775
Even when they're shot,
they don't die!

259
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,908
Are they soldiers
from Fort Briggs?

260
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:54,175
[Olivier] Idiots!

261
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,275
How dare you
compare my brave men

262
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:59,241
with such disgusting
specimens as those?!

263
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:02,208
I'm guessing... they're
the same as this guy.

264
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,208
The one who gave you
your orders must have

265
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,108
sent those things out
here for the attack.

266
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:07,941
Look, we don't know anything

267
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:10,775
about these creatures,
understand?!

268
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,808
Well then, I guess
they don't care...

269
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:16,508
It doesn't matter to them
whether you know or not.

270
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:19,541
[Dummies roar]

271
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:24,875
All right, soldier...
What's it gonna be?

272
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,175
My brother and I can take
care of these monsters.

273
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:30,041
Maybe so, but...

274
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,041
[Soldiers shudder]

275
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,741
[Soldier screams]

276
00:19:47,741 --> 00:19:52,641
[Sloth groans]

277
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,775
[Soldier shudders]

278
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,241
Well, what's it gonna be?!

279
00:19:58,241 --> 00:19:59,775
Do you plan on shooting us,

280
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,108
and then fall prey
to the monsters after?

281
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:03,875
Or are you going
to work with us

282
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,208
and bring them down together?!

283
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,941
Make up your own
damn minds, now!

284
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,775
[May squeals]

285
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:12,875
[Envy yells]

286
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:16,841
You brat!

287
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,075
[Dummies moan]

288
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:21,675
Ah! There's more of you!?

289
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:23,008
[Dummies growl]

290
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:24,808
[May yells]

291
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,275
[May squeals]

292
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,075
You're wasting your time...
All of these mannequin

293
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:39,908
soldiers have been infused
with Philosopher's Stones...

294
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:43,041
You aren't going to be able
to kill them that easily!

295
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:47,041
[Dummy struggles]

296
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:50,175
See now? That's what
you get for running away.

297
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:52,275
[Dummy growls]

298
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,641
My, these soldiers are tasty!

299
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:57,541
And with this, I'm
even stronger now!

300
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:02,041
You don't you get it, do you?

301
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,741
I doubt I'd last very long

302
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:05,808
against a whole army
of mannequins...

303
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:09,608
but I know that I can dodge
just one of you all day!

304
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:11,675
Silence, you brat!

305
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,541
[May] <i>All of these
mannequins have been infused</i>

306
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:22,041
<i>with Philosopher's Stones...
so they won't die...</i>

307
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,775
<i>That's where their
immortality comes from...</i>

308
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:30,775
<i>But I'll still find a way...
I must... to save my clan!</i>

309
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:33,675
[Ed yells]

310
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:38,008
[Scar grunts]

311
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:41,775
[Dummies moan]

312
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:46,875
They're really still coming?
Why won't they die?!

313
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:54,508
I'm running out of quills!

314
00:21:54,508 --> 00:21:57,241
My spit's starting
to dry up, too.

315

[Dummies moan]

316
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,608
Damn it!

317
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,041
Stop it!

318
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,941
Look out!

319
00:22:10,941 --> 00:22:12,675
[Ed gasps]

320
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,941
[Roy] Things do always
seem to get messy

321
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,841
whenever you're around.

322
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:31,575
Maybe I could lend you
a hand... Fullmetal?

323
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,908
[Narrator] <i>When someone

324
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:08,708
