Heh heh heh heh...

there yourself soon enough.

It is!

00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:13,393

Somebody...!

00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:47,263
This is Amestris, a major
alchemical power...!

Is there nobody...? Anybody?!

Why this?

one of my subjects...

dealt a lethal blow.

You made sure Fu's
death was not in vain

Still, I can do nothing for you.

64
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,696
I need more ammo!

you owe me one...

are to keep this

00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:58,051
until we get the all-clear
from our general...

76
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,451
I'm asking you...

77
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:03,751
to defend it for me.

78
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:08,117
Surely you can do that...

79
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:11,551
With your power...
you might be...

80
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:16,017
the only one who can
do it... So will you?

left before what I have to do.

[BRIGGS SOLDIER 5]
Yes sir.

kick the bucket in peace.

agree with me.

Farewell to you... comrades...

128
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:54,017

No, nothing.

checked all the stations?

[OLD MAN]
I have, and all they're saying

140
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:31,417
is that we should
stay in our homes.

00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,051
that it's not a good
idea to go out today...

00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,717
You can go over to

Come on, what do
you say, Elicia?

Perhaps--I believe the Elric

No.

Yes, Captain Buccaneer

00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,768
they fought Fuhrer Bradley...

...trying to defend
the main gate...

174
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:09,701
And they were all killed.

with the forces from Xing.

176

He inflicted a mortal

177
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:20,734

into the moat.

183
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,068
He's superhuman!

184
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:32,501
Ow!

185
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:37,001
[OLIVIER]
How's the main gate holding?

186
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,068
They're still defending it...

187
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:42,168
Are you familiar with the
homunculus known as Greed...?

188
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:45,268
He's come over to our
side, and he's helping.

189
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:47,201
One of them helping us?!

190
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:48,601
That's ridiculous...!

191
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,468
The 'good gentleman'
would never be betrayed

192
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:52,368
by the Homunculi.

193
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:54,034
About the captain...

194
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:56,401
they say he died smiling.

195
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:00,634
[OLIVIER]
I see...

196
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,434
Well if he indeed died smiling,

197
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,334
then he wouldn't want us
standing here weeping over him.

198
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:07,601
So, let's go!

199
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:09,501
[BRIGGS SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

200
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:12,068
[OLIVIER]
Mr. Sig, come with us.

201
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:14,168
We need to find
your wife, as well.

202
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,095
[screaming]

203
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,366
[thud]

204
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,133
[thud]

205
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,643
[woman groaning]

206
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:42,277
[ED]
Teacher!

207
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,843
Ed?!

208
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:47,377
Are you all right?

209
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:49,810
Yeah... more or less.

210
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,277
What're you doing here, anyway?

211
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:53,877
I'd like to know that, too...

212
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:56,843
So... Do you have
any clue where we are?

213
00:15:56,843 --> 00:16:00,910
[ED] None.... I just
ended up here same as you.

214
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,810
[crash thud]

215
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:05,277
[ED]
Al!

216
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,943
[ED]
Al...! Snap out of it...!

217
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:11,910
[IZUMI] Are the sacrifices
being gathered together?

218
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,943
[thud]

219
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:15,277
Huh?

220
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:18,677
[FATHER]
One... two... three...

221
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:22,910
[FATHER]
Four of you are here now...

222
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,777
That still leaves
us one short...

223
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,577
I wonder...

224
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:29,610
Huh...

225
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,743
Perhaps the fifth is
being created as we speak.

226
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,977
What... what is
that thing...?!

227
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,877
It's a monster!

228
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:38,677
Hohenheim!

229
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,510
Edward... Oh...

230
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,510
And it would seem he's
caught Alphonse as well...

231
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,243
Ah, and Izumi Curtis.

232
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:50,577
You'll have to excuse
my sorry appearance.

233
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,977
What is going on here?!

234
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:55,277
It's not complicated...

235
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:57,443
Be careful to
mind your place...

236
00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:59,343
I plan to take your
Philosopher's Stone

237
00:16:59,343 --> 00:17:00,343
at my leisure...

238
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:03,777
but I can speed up the
process if you prefer.

239
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:05,243
[ED]
Hohenheim...!

240
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:07,810
What is that hideous thing?!

241
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,843
[HOHENHEIM]
It's a copy of me...

242
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:11,543
You might know him better

243
00:17:11,543 --> 00:17:14,310
as the one the
Homunculi called "Father."

244
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,543
You're saying this is
that bearded bastard?

245
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:20,943
Yes, that's right...

246
00:17:20,943 --> 00:17:24,343
I destroyed the leather
bag he was in, but--

247
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,410
[FATHER]
Enough.

248
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,810
I warned you to keep your
mouth closed, Hohenheim.

249
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,810
And now... greetings
to the three of you...

250
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,943
my pretty sacrifices.

251
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:37,810
Welcome to my castle...

252
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,210
Please, everyone make
yourselves at home.

253
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:44,210
Al... time to get up...!

254
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,610
Things aren't looking
too good for us.

255
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,510
Hey, Al?

256
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,877
Al... Get up!

257
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:52,843
Alphonse!

258
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:58,677
[GOLD-TOOTH] Goodness, the
people up there are unreliable.

259
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,310
Honestly, they
can't even manage

260
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,810
to get five sacrifices
ready for today?

261
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,410
Though... they
did only go after

262
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,677
those who were
stupid enough to take

263
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:12,277
the bait of something small,

264
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:14,210
something like immortality.

265
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,477
It's no surprise they
failed to get the job done.

266
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:21,277
[gunshots]

267
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,810
[ROY]
You bastards! Let her go!

268
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:29,510
[ROY]
What--?!

269
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,410
[clapping]

270
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,743
[GOLD-TOOTH] All right, good...
Just hold him there.

271
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:46,710
Here we are...
Colonel Mustang...

272
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,677
I'm afraid we're
out of time...

273
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:49,977
At this point
you've no choice

274
00:18:49,977 --> 00:18:52,443
but to cooperate with us.

275
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:53,510
I would like you to perform

276
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,277
some human transmutation
and open a portal for me.

277
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:58,543
Are you serious?!

278
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:01,343
[GOLD-TOOTH]
It doesn't matter who.

279
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:06,677
A parent you've lost...
a lover... a friend...

280
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:08,943
Or that man you
were so close to...

281
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:10,943
I forget. What was
his name again...?

282
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:12,677
Hughes, right?

283
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:14,310
He'll do just fine...

284
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,577
I'll get things set up
for you right over here...

285
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:22,210
You mean I'm...
a sacrifice?

286
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,543
[GOLD-TOOTH]
Not yet...

287
00:19:23,543 --> 00:19:25,410
But as soon as you've
opened the portal,

288
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,843
you'll certainly
become one.

289
00:19:27,843 --> 00:19:30,777
[ROY] That's why the
Elric brothers were chosen?

290
00:19:30,777 --> 00:19:32,843
Yes, it is.

291
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:36,310
[ROY] They told me human
transmutation couldn't be done!

292
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,777
Why would I even try do
it knowing it would fail?!

293
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:42,410
You're right, there...

294
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,677
but all I really
need you to do

295
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:45,843
is open the portal
and then return.

296
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,543
No! Not a chance...!

297
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:49,377
I won't be your puppet...!

298
00:19:49,377 --> 00:19:51,443
You open it yourself!

299
00:19:55,877 --> 00:19:57,810
[GOLD-TOOTH]
I told you...

300
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,343
We have run out of time.

301
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:02,443
[splash]

302
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,477
[thud]

303
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:09,410
[ROY]
Lieutenant!

304
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,877
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

305
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,277
Now then...

306
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:14,843
maybe you've had a
change of heart...

307
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:16,810
what say you Mustang?

308
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,910
I'll kill you!

309
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,577
[ROY]
Lieutenant...!

310
00:20:21,577 --> 00:20:22,677
Are you still with me...?

311
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:23,943
Answer me!

312
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:26,577
Now... perform
the transmutation

313
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:29,310
and become the
fifth sacrifice.

314
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,277
Come on...
if you don't hurry,

315
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:36,743
the Lieutenant will
be lost to you forever.

316
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:38,543
Ah, I understand...

317
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:41,810
Would you like to transmute
her after she's already died...?

318
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,243
That would be acceptable.

319
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,443
I'm not gonna die.

320
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:51,410
What you don't know is...

321
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,943
is that I am under
strict orders not to die.

322
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:58,643
If it were that easy to obtain
an immortal body, my dear...

323
00:20:58,643 --> 00:20:59,810
it wouldn't be very sporting,

324
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,210
now would it?

325
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,943
[GOLD-TOOTH] So tell me,
Mustang, what will it be...?

326
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:07,543
Your precious woman
is about to die...

327
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:09,843
If you don't act,
she'll bleed to death...

328
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:13,410
All of that blood
right before your eyes.

329
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,810
Luckily, I happen
to be a doctor

330
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,777
who knows the
use of alchemy...

331
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,510
and I have a
Philosopher's Stone

332
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,577
to add to the
bargain as well.

333
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:24,443
Meaning this: I am able,
with all certainty,

334
00:21:24,443 --> 00:21:26,843
to save this woman's
life--but if you don't make up

335
00:21:26,843 --> 00:21:31,810
your mind in time...
there is nothing I can do.

336
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,443
Whether you like it or not,

337
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:36,977
her fate is up to you
now, Colonel Mustang...

338
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:40,543
Do you want her blood
forever on your hands?

339
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:48,543
She looks so quiet and still...

340
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:51,177
Perhaps she's dead.
What do you think?

341
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,810
[HAWKEYE]
Colonel... Please...

342
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,843
You don't have to do this...

343
00:21:56,843 --> 00:22:01,410
Don't sacrifice everything...
for my sake...

344
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,510
But you will do it.
Won't you, Mustang?

345
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:17,310
[GOLD-TOOTH]
Well?

346
00:22:28,777 --> 00:22:30,677
[ROY]
All right.

347
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:09,210
[NARRATOR] Perhaps, in the end,
<i>there is a silver lining...</i>

348
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,643
<i>but know that it
lasts but a moment...</i>

349
00:24:12,643 --> 00:24:15,443
<i>The ground upon which
you stand may fall out</i>

350
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:18,843
<i>beneath you at any time.</i>

351
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:22,610
<i>Next time, on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood...</i>

352
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,277
<i>Episode 59 "Lost Light."</i>

353
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:32,777
<i>And now... at last...
the end begins...</i>
