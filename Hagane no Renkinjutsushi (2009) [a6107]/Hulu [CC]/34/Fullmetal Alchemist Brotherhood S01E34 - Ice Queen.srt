00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:48,086
[FEMALE DOCTOR]
Yes, that's right.

3
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:48,953
You got lucky.

4
00:01:48,953 --> 00:01:51,753
You were close to
getting frostbite.

5
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:54,853
You need to be careful
walking around in a snowstorm...

6
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:57,819
The flesh that's touching
your automail will freeze...

7
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:00,453
and you need to oil it...
or it will stiffen.

8
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,286
So does that
Buccaneer guy have a

9
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:04,786
different kind of automail
or something?

10
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:08,319
It's no use, Doc.
I can't get this thing unstuck.

11
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,986
[AL]
Hey...! My head!

12
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,753
[FEMALE DOCTOR]
Up here, your automail has to be

13
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:15,686
flexible and lightweight...

14
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:18,819
It also needs to be
resistant to the cold.

15
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:21,886
After some trial and error,
we found an alloy that works...

16
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:23,419
A combination of dura-lumin,

17
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:27,019
carbon fiber, nickel,
copper, and so on...

18
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,153
And here I assumed
it was just iron...

19
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:33,153
It's no wonder I couldn't
do anything with it.

20
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,886
Hey, Doc... Be careful...

21
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:37,753
Are you planning on telling
him all our secrets?

22
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:39,853
Why wouldn't I?
He's a State Alchemist.

23
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:42,753
He has a right to
know, doesn't he?

24
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:44,786
You're kidding...

25
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:48,053
He has the pocketwatch.

26
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:49,253
[BUCCANEER THINKS]
You mean this kid is the

27
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,386
equivalent of a Major?

28
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:54,753
If you're going to be
in the north for long...

29
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:58,353
you should switch to a
different kind of automail...

30
00:02:58,353 --> 00:02:59,919
Do you have a mechanic?

31
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,819
Yes, but she's in Rush Valley.

32
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,086
[FEMALE DOCTOR] And she
let you come up north

33
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:06,886
without explaining
all of this to you first?

34
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,986
Not exactly... I didn't tell her

35
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:11,253
I was planning
on coming up here.

36
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:14,153
I'd recommend
you send for her...

37
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,753
assuming that you'd
like to stay alive.

38
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:19,119
Fine.

39
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,153
That'll be a hundred cens.

40
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,819
Seriously?!

41
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,053
It wasn't even
a good cup of coffee.

42
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:27,886
This is the north.
Get used to it.

43
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:31,019
[BUCCANEER] So you come up here
with mediocre automail...

44
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,153
completely ignorant
about the north...

45
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:35,319
and you try to bypass the
command center.

46
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,953
Oh, come on...! I hike up
here, a State Alchemist

47
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:39,319
with an official
letter of introduction,

48
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,186
and this is how I'm treated?!

49
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:42,319
What's wrong with you people?!

50
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,919
Do you have no
sense of propriety?

51
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,986
That general threatened
to tear my arms off!

52
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:49,019
Hello, little red runt.

53
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,453
L-Little... red...

54
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:51,253
If you have a problem,

55
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:54,053
then now's the
time to speak up.

M-My hair!

57
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:05,786
It looks awful.

58
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:13,120
[OLIVIER] Well now...
From what I hear,

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,453
you two are close
to my brother Alex.

60
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:19,086
Is he doing all right?

61
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:20,453
Uh... Yeah!

62
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:22,586
The big, strong guy
we know and love.

63
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:24,520

[OLIVIER ANGRY]

65
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:29,453
No matter... Never mind him.

66
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:33,020
Tell me why you would bypass
the command center to meet me.

67
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,286
[OLIVIER]
I want to know it all.

68
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:37,320
Including why
your armor's empty.

69
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:42,053
Actually... that's something
we don't like to talk about.

70
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:43,553
There's no reason to worry...

71
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:46,086
Folks around here have
plenty they want to hide...

72
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,486
Everybody up north has something

73
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:50,186
that he or she doesn't
like to talk about.

74
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:53,186
But... if this information
reaches certain ears,

75
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:54,553
I could be court-martialed.

76
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:57,586
[OLIVIER]
Even I have secrets like that.

77
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:00,120
[AL]
Brother... listen.

78
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,386
[AL] I really think
we have to tell her.

79
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:06,020
[ED] But Winry's a
hostage... I don't know.

80
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,386
Maybe if we
can do it without

81
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:09,686
mentioning the Fuhrer
or the homunculi...

82
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,420
What are you
whispering about?

83
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,286
Start talking now!

84
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:14,620

Fine... let's just tell her

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,920
we're trying to
get our bodies back.

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,553
[OLIVIER] I see...
So that's why you're looking

87
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:31,686
for this girl
with the strange cat.

88
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:33,986
I understand.

you're going to help u--

You two are a couple
of reckless wretches

who cause trouble
with every last thing you do!

00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:46,286
[OLIVIER CONTINUES] I don't
want people like you in my fort.

94
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:48,286

How could the people at

95
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:51,253

two run around loose?

96

At least that's
what I'd like to say,

00:05:58,086 --> 00:06:00,286
but I'm interested
in alkahestry...

00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:03,353
You two... You're acquainted
with this girl from Xing?

Yeah... we have.

102
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,353
She has a skill our
country doesn't... right?

103
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,453
[OLIVIER]
You can never know too much...

104
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:14,153
Especially here in the north,

105
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:17,020
where we're right
next to Drachma.

106
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,320
[OLIVIER]
If we use it right...

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,020
alkahestry could make
an excellent weapon.

108
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,086

Wait a second!

for medical purposes...

Those two boys haven't exactly

127
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,120
I believe that they
may have witnessed

some carnage in their time,

129
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:12,586
but I can tell
that on the inside

130
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:15,253

the soldiers from Ishval

were purged before
the Extermination.

147

[MILES] It's true that Ishvalan
blood flows in my veins...

Since the war,
Amestrians always view me

nearly killed me,

170

My feelings
are a bit conflicted.

173
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:31,185
Besides... I think people should
try to ignore their race...

174
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:34,585
and just treat

Major Miles, were you on

176

177
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,719
[MILES]
Yes, I was...

General Armstrong's

after I was posted here...

00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,519
were killed in the East...

183
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,485
I fell outside the military's
purge requirements,

184
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:05,185

the military's actions...

192

keep me as her Staff Officer.

[MILES CONTINUES] The presence
of someone with Ishvalan

00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:03,955
There might be others coming!

346
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:14,355
[WORKMAN A]
That's all the boxes we have.

347
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:29,855
Whoa!

348
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:34,621
It's warm... here.

349
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:36,621
[OLIVIER]
Don't move!

350
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:39,555
[MISSLE HITS AND EXPLODES]

351
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:44,455
Put it out.

352
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:46,088
Sir!

353
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:58,455
I know that I hit it.

354
00:18:58,455 --> 00:19:00,621
[BUCCANEER]
It's no use!

355
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:02,588
Firearms won't work against him!

356
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:03,555
[OLIVIER]
What?!

357
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:06,355
Withdraw all noncombatants immediately...

358
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,088
Shut off the alarm!

359
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:09,321
It won't help anything if the

360
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:11,521
Drachmans figure out
that we're in trouble.

361
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:14,288
[TANK OFFICER A]
General...! We have tanks!

362
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,921
[OLIVIER]
Have the trials been completed?

363
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,955
We don't need to
worry about "trials"...

364
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,288
These are the development
team's pride and joy...

365
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:23,288
Remove the fuses
from the shells.

366
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,055
[TANK OFFICER A]
Yes, Sir!

367
00:19:34,455 --> 00:19:35,288
Ready to go...!

368
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:36,921
The first round's
locked and loaded!

369
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:38,488
Fire!

370
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,221
Yeah...! Dead on!

371
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,088
Ou... ch...

372
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:58,088
[SLOTH]
Pain is a pain.

373
00:19:58,088 --> 00:20:00,555
Pain is annoying.

374
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:05,855
Don't just sit there...!
Load the next round!

375
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:10,155
Fire!

376
00:20:23,688 --> 00:20:26,121
Ouch.

377
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:29,921
Right back... to work.

378
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:32,121
[SLOTH]
Dig... a hole...

379
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:53,955
It won't work...!

380
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,155
Try whatever you want to,
but he won't die!

381
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,988
He won't?

382
00:20:57,988 --> 00:20:59,355
Just what are you saying...?

383
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:03,488
How does a kid like you
know something like that, huh?

384
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:06,188
Be... because we...

385
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:07,355
[OLIVIER]
Drop the act...!

386
00:21:07,355 --> 00:21:10,888
You will answer all my questions
clearly and completely...

387
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:13,288
First off-- How do you
know about that thing...?

388
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,021
Are you a Drachman spy?

389
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:16,588
I'm not!

390
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:18,055
[OLIVIER]
Is that thing a spy?

391
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:20,088
[ED]
I really doubt it.

392
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:21,555
[OLIVIER]
Does that thing know you?

393
00:21:21,555 --> 00:21:23,521
[ED]
No, apparently not.

394
00:21:23,521 --> 00:21:26,055
[OLIVIER]
What is that thing?

395
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,388
I can't answer.

396
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,255
[OLIVIER]
Who does that thing work for?

397
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,355
I can't answer that!

398
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:35,955
Why can't you answer me?

399
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:39,221
I can't answer.

400
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:44,121
This is my last question...

401
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:45,321
Are you on our side,

402
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:47,121
or are you in
league with that thing?

403
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:48,088
I'm not with him.

404
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:51,421
I don't want to see
anyone here get hurt.

405
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:54,621
Then tell me what
that thing's made of.

406
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:56,355
[ED] His body's structure
and compositional

407
00:21:56,355 --> 00:21:59,621
elements are probably
the same as a human's.

408
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:02,255
The same as a human's, huh?

409
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,121
Buccaneer, bring me
some tank fuel, now...!

410
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:07,388
We're going to douse it.

411
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:08,221
Sir!

412
00:22:08,221 --> 00:22:09,888
I told you, it won't
work, General...

413
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:11,988
Set him on fire,
but he still won't die.

414
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:13,388
I understand--
I learned from our

415
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:15,288
last attack
that we can't kill it...

416
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:18,088
The best that we can hope
for is to stop or delay it...

417
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:19,188
So we'll have to hit it with

418
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:21,955
something even
stronger than fire.

419
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:29,388
Now you get to see the
"Briggs way," kid.
