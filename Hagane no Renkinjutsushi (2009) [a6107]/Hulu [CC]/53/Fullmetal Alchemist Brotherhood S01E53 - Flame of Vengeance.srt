1
00:01:33,047 --> 00:01:33,863
[Citizen 1] Wh-What's going on?

2
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:34,839
[Citizen 2] Is the
city under attack?

3
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:35,739
[Citizen 3] I don't know.

4
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:36,806
[Citizen 4] I heard
the Flame Alchemist

5
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:37,873
turned enemy of the state.

6
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:38,973
[Citizen 5] Are you
sure about that?

7
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,606
[Citizen 4] Well,
that's the rumor.

8
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:42,839
Hey! You got a radio in here?

9
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:45,506
Quick! Turn it on to
Radio Capital! Hurry!

10
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,339
The public news station?

11
00:01:47,339 --> 00:01:50,039
Yeah. You aren't gonna
believe what's going on.

12
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,406
There's never anything
good on that station.

13
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:53,573
Just turn it on!

14
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:57,306
Before the military shuts
down the broadcast! Come on!

15
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:03,506
[Broadcaster] Do I understand
you correctly, Mrs. Bradley?

16
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:06,306
The "Mrs. Bradley"?

17
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:09,906
[Bradley's Wife] That's
right. Our own military...

18
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:11,906
They attempted
to have me killed.

19
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,806
You mean, someone
gave out that order?

20
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:19,806
They actually pointed
their guns at you?

21
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,706
They did. They specifically
said to shoot me

22
00:02:23,706 --> 00:02:28,039
and Colonel Mustang's
men. It was awful.

23
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,339
[Broadcaster] Fuhrer Bradley
went east to preside over

24
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:34,373
a military exercise and has
yet to return to Central.

25
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:35,506
[Bradley's Wife] That's correct.

26
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:37,806
[Broadcaster] So then,
it would seem that an official

27
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:41,373
took advantage of his absence
in order to stage a coup.

28
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:43,406
[Bradley's Wife]
That I do not know.

29
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:45,506
Is that really Mrs. Bradley?

30
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:48,706
I've heard her speak before.
That's her, alright.

31
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:49,906
[Broadcaster] I imagine
you must be relieved

32
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:52,506
that your son is traveling
with his father.

33
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,006
[Bradley's Wife] I haven't
been able to contact my son.

34
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:56,506
[Broadcaster] You haven't?

35
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:57,773
You're kidding!

36
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:58,773
[Bradley's Wife sobs]

37
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:00,373
That poor woman.

38
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:02,739
I sure hope little
Selim's alright.

39
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,306
[Broadcaster] Please try to
remain calm, Mrs. Bradley.

40
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:05,473
[Customer 1] A coup d'état?

41
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:06,406
[Customer 2] They're
fools if they think

42
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,506
they can run this country
without Bradley.

43
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:10,039
[Bradley's Wife sobs]

44
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,006
If... If Colonel Mustang
hadn't saved me...

45
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:16,473
I'm certain they
would've killed me.

46
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:19,039
[Broadcaster] I see. it sounds
as though Colonel Mustang

47
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,339
was expecting this coup d'état.

48
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:21,939
Did he say Mustang?

49
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,973
[Broadcaster] If it's not
too difficult, do you think

50
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:27,639
you could describe the exact
details of your rescue for us?

51
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,339
Okay.

52
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:31,873
She doesn't know
Selim's a Homunculus?

53
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:33,806
Don't you think that
someone should tell her?

54
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:37,506
How can we? We still
haven't even told her

55
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:40,506
that Fuhrer Bradley is missing.

56
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:41,806
[Bradley's Wife]
But that's when--

57
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,506
[Broadcaster and
Bradley's wife gasp]

58
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:46,039
There's something we haven't
told Mrs. Bradley yet...

59
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,039
but she needs to hear it.

60
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,673
The Fuhrer was
returning to Central...

61
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:52,539
But his train was blown up.

62
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,473
[Bradley's Wife gasps]

63
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:56,506
I'm sorry, but we
have yet to find him.

64
00:03:56,506 --> 00:04:00,906
[Bradley's Wife
gasps, exhales]

65
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:03,439
[Broadcaster] Mrs. Bradley!

66
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,406
Is she still conscious?

67
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:08,039
Uh... Well, uh--
Mrs. Bradley fainted.

68
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,739
She's understandably
a little overwhelmed

69
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,039
by the news we all just
received. And about that...

70
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,673
What exactly did you
mean when you said

71
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:17,006
that you have yet
to find the Fuhrer?

72
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:21,306
Well you should
know this first...

73
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:24,373
The Colonel's suspected the
senior staff of foul play.

74
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:27,973
And he's expected them to
make a move for some time now.

75
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:30,806
So with the Fuhrer's train
having been bombed...

76
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:34,039
And the orders given to
assassinate Mrs. Bradley...

77
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,673
His suspicions were confirmed.

78
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:39,539
We know for a fact.
Someone's attempting

79
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:41,806
to overthrow the government.

80
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:43,506
[Cremin] Listen, you fool!

81
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:45,973
I want that
broadcast shut down!

82
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:48,806
Do you have any idea the
damage that this is causing?!

83
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:52,306
I only wish it was that
easy, sir... but I can't.

84
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,039
They've taken the
whole studio hostage...

85
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,773
We're sitting here with
guns pointed at our heads...

86
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:58,839
We're lucky that
we're still alive.

87
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,939
The only reason they
haven't shot any of us

88
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:04,373
is because we're
following their orders.

89
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:06,039
Put Mustang on the phone!

90
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,473
I want to speak to
that traitor directly!

91
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:11,673
Uh, Mustang? He's, um...

92
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:15,939
Uh...

93
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,439
Ah! Ahh! Don't shoot!

94
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,506
Nooo! Don't shoot me!
I'm sorry!

95
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:25,639
[sound of phone
being hung up]

96
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,506
[busy signal]

97
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:32,773
[Cremin snarls]

98
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:35,339
[laughter]

99
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,573
How was my performance?

100
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,339
You should win an award!

101
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,839
Back to it! Don't
stop broadcasting!

102
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,639
Right!

103
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,473
There's no way
I'm gonna abandon

104
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,439
the story of the century!

105
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,706
[Broadcaster]
To continue with our story,

106
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:48,306
we now have an
exclusive message

107
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,806
from one of Colonel
Mustang's men.

108
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:53,806
So Colonel Mustang isn't
behind the uprising?

109
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:56,773
[Ross] Those of us giving our
support to Colonel Mustang...

110
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,339
We may be few in number...

111
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,939
[Brosh] That.. voice...
[Ross] But that won't stop us

112
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,906
from protecting the
legacy of the Fuhrer.

113
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:04,306
We'll do everything we can
to stop these traitors

114
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:06,339
in the name of justice.

115
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,439
[Brosh sighs joyfully]

116
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,039
[Grumman laughs]

117
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,639
Brilliant play, Mustang.
Taking advantage

118
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,339
of the Fuhrer's absence
and using his influence

119
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:19,739
any way you like
to suit your needs.

120
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:23,039
And invoking the name
of justice at that.

121
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,039
Let's keep our fingers crossed
that the public accepts it.

122
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,739
[Breda] You sounded like a pro.

123
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:34,406
And that last bit, about
"justice"... Nice touch.

124
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:36,073
Well, of course.
Everyone's willing

125
00:06:36,073 --> 00:06:38,506
to fight for justice.
So I said it.

126
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:42,039
That's right. And in this war,
it belongs to us.

127
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,006
[indistinct murmurring]

128
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:45,039
[Man 1] Does anyone
know what's going on?

129
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,739
Mustang's men say that they're
trying to prevent an uprising.

130
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:50,473
Are you sure
he's not behind it?

131
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:53,506
[Ishvalan 1] Roy Mustang
is telling the truth.

132
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:56,373
We've just arrived in
Central from East Amestris.

133
00:06:56,373 --> 00:06:58,039
We witnessed the wreckage
of the Fuhrer's train

134
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,839
with our own eyes. It is true.

135
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,906
The leader of your
country is missing...

136
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:05,073
And no one has even
informed you yet?

137
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:07,406
Our Fuhrer could be
dead for all we know.

138
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:10,506
Why would they keep all of us
in the dark about such a thing?

139
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:12,806
The military must be
staging a coup d'état!

140
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:14,306
[Citizen 8] But
who's behind it?!

141
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:15,639
[Citizen 9] If they
storm the radio station

142
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,906
and kill Mrs. Bradley...

143
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:18,839
Then we'll know it's
the senior staff.

144
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,739
[Citizen 11] Selim!
What about little Selim?!

145
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,739
[Citizen 12] Do you think
he's been taken prisoner?

146
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:24,739
[Citizen 13] I just
hope he's safe.

147
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,039
[concerned murmurs]

148
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,906
[Unidentified Citizen]
Mrs. Bradley...

149
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:33,339
[Gate Captain] What is the
garrison doing down there?!

150
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:34,639
[Subordinate 1] Well,
sir, the enemy seems

151
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,039
to possess more firepower
than we expected.

152
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,773
They're putting up
a strong offense.

153
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:41,506
Hmph. No excuse!
They're on foot.

154
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:43,839
I doubt they have
that much firepower!

155
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,039
[Subordinate 2] We have a
transmission from the garrison!

156
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,539
You should hear this.

157
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,039
You're late checking in!

158
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,773
I want a detailed
rundown. Now go ahead.

159
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,506
[Garrison Soldier]
The... The Briggs soldiers!

160
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:55,773
Th-They actually have a--

161
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:58,839
Ah...! Hey, what's happening?!

162
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,906
[Gate Captain growls]

163
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,996
Sir? Is everything okay?
I mean, we aren't going to

164
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:08,787
lose the main gate
to them, are we, sir?

165
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:10,920
Of course not!

166
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,220
Ridiculous!
That's impossible!

167
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,454
They'd need a tank to
breach the main gate.

168
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:19,954
Huh?

169
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:21,387
What?!

170
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:23,954
[fighting sounds]

171
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:27,387
Maybe I could lend you
a hand... Fullmetal?

172
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,020
Colonel?!

173
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,954
[Gerso gurgles, Darius grunts]

174
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:32,754
You just manage
to make new friends

175
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:35,020
everywhere you go... Hm?

176
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,754
[Scar grunts]

177
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,187
Is that Scar?

178
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,020
I can't help but
think of the last time

179
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,687
we were here, Lieutenant.

180
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:46,087
As I recall, you were
crying over me.

181
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:49,920
Shame I don't get to see that
softer side of you more often.

182
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,954
The last thing I'm gonna do
is start crying for you now.

183
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:54,920
Water makes you useless.

184
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:59,920
Save your banter for later!
Kill these things!

185
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,720
Hey, don't you dare
give me orders!

186
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,887
He's right! Just start
shooting at these white guys.

187
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:07,187
No, save your ammo!

188
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,187
Bullets won't even
slow 'em down!

189
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:10,320
[Dummy roars]

190
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,987
Not again! How else
do we kill them?

191
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,354
They're Homunculi?

192
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:19,754
No... They aren't
healing themselves.

193
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:21,887
But they're not dying, either.

194
00:09:21,887 --> 00:09:24,420
They've got to be powered
by Philosopher's Stones.

195
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,454
[Ed yells]

196
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:31,154
[fighting sounds]

197
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:35,820
[Ed pants]

198
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:50,120
[Dummies scream in agony]

199
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:55,020
[Gerso and Darius]
Uh... Huh?

200
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:03,754
[Ed shudders]

201
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:07,187
They were the enemy.
It had to be done.

202
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:12,754
[Ed shudders, exhales]

203
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:14,893
[May pants]

204
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:17,861
[Envy] Stop scampering
around, dammit!

205
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:20,494
[May] <i>He obviously doesn't
want me to go this way.</i>

206
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:24,161
<i>And the chi is stronger
down here. I knew it!</i>

207
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,161
[Envy grunts, yells]

208
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:28,561
[May cries, struggles]

209
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,561
[May grunts]

210
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:35,194
[Envy cries out]

211
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:37,427
[Envy yells]

212
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:41,827
[May cries]

213
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:44,727
[pipes creak]

214
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:54,161
[Gerso] Is that May?

215
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:57,361
[Envy coughs]

216
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:58,561
Envy?!

217
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:01,061
Eh? Not you guys...

218
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:03,261
[Envy growls]

219
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,327
[May grunts]

220
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:07,694
You damn fool! Why didn't
you go back to Xing?!

221
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:12,561
But I.. I thought...
I just wanted to...

222
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:15,294
[Scar] Forget it. Don't cry.

223
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:17,861
[May] Please forgive me.
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:23,827
Bleh. Typical whiny humans.
You're making my stomach turn.

225
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:25,061
[Envy sighs]

226
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:32,494
I gotta admit, you guys really
made a serious mess down here.

227
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:34,561
So, we've got the
Fullmetal Alchemist

228
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:38,194
and the Flame Alchemist...
And there's even Scar...

229
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:41,761
And I've got a serious grudge
with you filthy chimera.

230
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:45,727
So, then... Who gets the
pleasure of being first to die?

231
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,827
[Roy] You're Envy, right?
[Envy] Hm?

232
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:51,394
You're the Homunculus who can
change his appearance at will.

233
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:55,694
Wow! You've heard
of me! I'm flattered!

234
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:57,661
Nice to meet you, Colonel.

235
00:11:57,661 --> 00:12:02,361
Hold on. You're teaming up
with him, Scar? You do know

236
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:05,361
that he helped reduce
Ishval to a hell on earth?

237
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:08,327
I'm aware of that.

238
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:12,794
What?! You're friends now?
You guys are no fun at all!

239
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:16,227
What happened to trying to
crush each other's windpipes?

240
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:17,827
Look at the two of you!

241
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:21,461
You obviously wanna
kill each other, so do it!

242
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:24,361
[Roy sighs] We aren't
going to be the pawns

243
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:26,494
in your sick little
game anymore.

244
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:30,627
Really? And what
about your sick games?

245
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:33,761
Don't kid yourself, Mustang.
You know humans love to watch

246
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:37,161
other people suffer while
making fools of themselves.

247
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:39,161
I mean, why else
would you constantly

248
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:41,194
be at war with each other?

249
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,094
Hm. There really is
nothing quite like

250
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:46,294
watching fools dig
their own graves.

251
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:48,527
[Envy whistles]

252
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:52,294
Especially when that fool
is an arrogant Homunculus

253
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:54,827
who's too stupid to
see what he's doing.

254
00:12:54,827 --> 00:12:57,127
[Envy] Hm...

255
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,427
[Roy] I've humored
you long enough.

256
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:02,727
So how about you answer
a question of mine?

257
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:06,827
I want you to tell me
who killed Maes Hughes.

258
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,194
[Ed gasps]

259
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:10,761
And I want the truth... Homunculus.

260
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:19,827
Maria Ross did. Isn't that
why you burned her to death?

261
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:21,294
[Roy] Shut up.

262
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:23,194
I know that she didn't kill him.

263
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:25,427
Huh? You mean to tell me

264
00:13:25,427 --> 00:13:29,127
that you scorched an innocent
girl to a pile of ashes?

265
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:31,594
Nicely done, you monster!

266
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:33,861
Wow. Must've been fun
telling her family...

267
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:36,261
Did you cry when you told them?

268
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:39,461
Or did you sit back quietly
and endure their outrage?

269
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:42,194
Quit running your
mouth, you idiot.

270
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:46,394
I'm sick of you Homunculi
giving me the runaround

271
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:49,827
when I ask you this question.

272
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,294
Tell me the truth or I'll
burn it out of you...

273
00:13:52,294 --> 00:13:53,861
You worthless scum.

274
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:55,827
[Envy groans]

275
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:59,194
Tell me who's responsible
for his murder.

276
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:13,861
[Envy laughs]

277
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:17,294
[Envy] Congratulations,
Colonel Mustang.

278
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:19,661
You've finally hunted
down your culprit.

279
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,827
[Roy and Hawkeye grunt]

280
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,827
[Envy giggles]

281
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:27,827
You're saying that
you killed Hughes?

282
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:31,561
I doubt a moron like you
could pull that off.

283
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:37,194
[Envy] Moron? Tell me who
the real moron is here.

284
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:39,227
Because I don't think it's me.

285
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:40,727
[Ed gasps]

286
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:43,161
I prefer to use that
term for someone

287
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:45,727
who falls for a
cheap trick like this.

288
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:48,361
[Roy gasps]

289
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:51,661
Ha ha! You should see your face!

290
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:53,661
Ah, you're not gonna
believe this...

291
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:57,427
But that was the same look on
Hughes' face when I shot him!

292
00:14:57,427 --> 00:15:00,161
The utter shock...
The dumb confusion...

293
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:02,427
You could see every
emotion he felt

294
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:04,561
as his own wife shot him.

295
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:08,194
Ah... It... was.. great!

296
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:10,294
[Ed seethes]

297
00:15:10,294 --> 00:15:13,294
[Roy] That's enough.

298
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:15,827
You were stupid
enough to confess...

299
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:18,361
and even more stupid to boast.

300
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:23,261
Everything you've said is
fuel on your funeral pyre.

301
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:27,594
So then... I think
I'll begin...

302
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,627
by burning out your tongue.

303
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,727
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

304
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:39,263
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

305
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,567
Stand down, all of you.

306
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:52,167
I'm dealing with him on my own.

307
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,367
This one is mine
and mine alone...

308
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,800
Well. You heard him.

309
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,733
Let's keep moving and
find this Father guy. Ah!

310
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,667
[Envy] I don't remember giving
you permission to leave.

311
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:09,600
I still owe you some pain
and misery for what you did--

312
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,433
[Envy screams]

313
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:14,733
Keep your eyes on me, Envy.

314
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:17,633
Our conversation is the only
one that should concern you.

315
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:18,900
[Envy grunts]

316
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,633
[Roy] It's kind of
interesting how quickly

317
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:23,767
the tongue can be rendered
to a bubbling grease...

318
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:27,367
It's surprising how easy
it burns... Isn't it?

319
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,567
Lieutenant.. You really
think the two of you--

320
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:33,600
[Hawkeye] Edward. Just go.
We can handle this one.

321
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,867
Are you sure?

322
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:38,800
The Lieutenant said go, Elric.

323
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,400
You've got more important
matters to deal with.

324
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,267
He's right, Ed. Now let's go.

325
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:46,767
[Ed] Hold on!

326
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:53,733
Damn it!

327
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:56,533
[Darius] The Colonel's
gonna be fine.

328
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,200
You saw that back there.

329
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,667
This won't even be
a challenge for him.

330
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:03,333
That's not exactly what
I'm worried about.

331
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,833
Huh? Then what's the problem?

332
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,667
[Envy] So... You've
been rather dogged

333
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,667
in your pursuit
of Hughes' killer.

334
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:16,667
You're a true friend
to the very end...

335
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:23,333
[Envy yells, roars]

336
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,467
Keep your distance, Lieutenant.

337
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:38,400
Out of respect for your
tireless quest for vengeance,

338
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,833
I'll give you the fight
you're looking for.

339
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:44,433
I'm not exactly capable of
treading lightly in this body.

340
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:46,500
So you better give
it all you've--

341
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,733
[Envy roars in pain]

342
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:53,933
What's it like having the fluid
inside of your eyes boil?

343
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,267
I'd imagine it
might sting a little.

344
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:57,400
Damn you!

345
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,267
[Roy snaps, Envy screams]

346
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,800
[Roy] I can't believe you'd
give me a bigger target.

347
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
Did you think that
size would increase

348
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,933
your chance of winning?
You idiot. Stand up, monster!

349
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,933
Go on and regenerate yourself.

350
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,800
You'll suffer a thousand
deaths before I'm done.

351
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,400
[Envy] <i>That's right.
How could I forget?</i>

352
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,667
<i>He's the one who
incinerated Lust to death.</i>

353
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,600
[Envy growls]

354
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
[Roy] You coward!
[Hawkeye] Colonel!

355
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
[Roy] You wait here,
Lieutenant!

356
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,833
I'm going to take
care of him myself!

357
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:45,300
[May] This way.
It's gotta be this way.

358
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,400
This place is creepy.

359
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,533
These tubes are like veins.
And the further we get,

360
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:53,400
the more it feels like I've
got a bad case of heartburn.

361
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,233
I'm not surprised.
I've got it too.

362
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:59,567
There's a strong mass
of rancid chi ahead.

363
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:00,900
Rancid chi?

364
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,933
You know how you can
feel a crowd's fear

365
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,400
before a disaster? It's like
that, but it's far worse.

366
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,267
I don't really understand...

367
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:11,167
but it sure is scarin'
the hell outta' me.

368
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:14,700
[Gerso] This is the last place

369
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,433
I'd want to run into
that Father guy.

370
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,367
Scar. I need to talk to you.

371
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:26,367
It's about the Flame
Alchemist, isn't it?

372
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,900
It wasn't that long ago
that I was a monster.

373
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,267
I understand the burning desire
for revenge all too well.

374
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:37,633
The way he's headed...

375
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:40,833
He will destroy himself
in the flames of hatred...

376
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,733
And it's doubtful that
he will ever recover.

377
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,633
[Ed gasps]

378
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,533
[Envy screams]

379
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,933
[Roy] Show yourself, Envy!

380
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:04,367
Damn it!

381
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,333
[Roy] Come out now.

382
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,433
Otherwise, I'm gonna
ignite your bone marrow.

383
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,667
Roy! What's up?

384
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,900
[Envy] <i>Stupid human!
He won't kill his friend!</i>

385
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
[Roy growls, snaps]

386
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,800
[Envy screams]

387
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,533
What's wrong with you?!

388
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:25,433
You didn't even hesitate to
incinerate your best friend!

389
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,733
Maes Hughes is dead.
That's a fact.

390
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,400
And you invoke his image?

391
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,933
You must be a glutton
for punishment. Hya!

392
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:36,700
[Envy screams]

393
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,467
Damn! I'll show you
real punishment!

394
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:44,400
[Roy snaps, Envy screams]

395
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,400
[Envy] Again?! My eyes!
They're gone!

396
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,633
[Roy] So I'm curious.

397
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:52,733
Were you trying to get close
so I wouldn't use heavy fire?

398
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,733
No one told you that I
can do pinpoint aiming?

399
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:58,267
Too bad for you...
Because I can!

400
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:01,300
[Roy snaps, Envy screams]

401
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:09,267
Colonel... I'm sorry,
but I can't wait.

402
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:15,700
[Envy screams, writhes]

403
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:22,167
Tch. You're not getting away.

404
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,200
[Envy chuckles]

405
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,200
[footsteps]

406
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,900
I told you to stay
behind, Lieutenant.

407
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,400
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
just sit there, sir.

408
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,800
Where's Envy?

409
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,533
He outran me. This place
is like a labyrinth.

410
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:13,933
Well, you might as well help me
kill him now that you're here.

411
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:16,800
Stay right by my
side, Lieutenant.

412
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,733
[Roy] Hm?

413
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,900
[Narrator] <i>The years that pass
between the moment of birth</i>

414
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,367
<i>and the moment of death
are the true materials</i>

415
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:11,867
<i>that construct a human being.</i>

416
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:16,200
<i>Time must accumulate to create
a genuine and robust self,</i>

417
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,933
but the person is only complete
<i>in their final moment.</i>

418
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:23,667
<i>Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood...</i>

419
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:28,700
<i>Episode 54:
"Beyond the Inferno."</i>

420
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,733
<i>Look closely at yourself.
Examine what's in your heart.</i>
