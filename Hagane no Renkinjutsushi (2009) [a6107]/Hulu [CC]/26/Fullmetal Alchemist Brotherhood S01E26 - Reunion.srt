1
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:47,327
[crashing and yelling]

2
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:48,631
Run, Ed!

3
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:50,264
[Envy] Bastard!

4
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:53,631
[crash]

5
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:54,531
[splash]

6
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,898
[Ed] Ling!

7
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,664
Alright, Envy... Time to die!

8
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:04,631
Help me... Kill me...

9
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:10,364
Help me die... I beg you...
Please kill me... Please!

10
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:16,298
[evil laughter]

11
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:19,298
[voices]
I don't want to die.
Where's my mommy?

12
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:21,964
[voices] Come closer, boy.
Help me.

13
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,631
[laughter]

14
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,598
Come on! Snap
out of it, you idiot!

15
00:02:34,598 --> 00:02:36,798
Why didn't you attack him?

16
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:40,564
A person... Those are people...

17
00:02:40,564 --> 00:02:43,298
They need our help...
They're trapped inside him!

18
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:46,198
[Ling] That's a trick,
Ed...! He's a monster!

19
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:47,798
But they-

20
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:51,664
Listen to me! Those
things are monsters!

21
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:53,398
[voices] Kill me!
Can you feel the power?

22
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:56,564
[voices] Mommy!
Give me back my son!

23
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:58,631
Shut up...! Stop it!

24
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:00,664
[voices] Father!
Do you like this power?

25
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:02,564
[voices] Please let me die!
Help us!

26
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:03,464
Stoooop!

27
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:06,298
[Nina] Big brother.

28
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:10,431
Wanna play?

29
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:11,731
Let's play.

30
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:16,898
I'm done playing with you.

31
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:21,664
[Ed screaming]

32
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:32,831
[Ed] Al... I'm sorry.

33
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:41,664
[voices] Come join us.

34
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:43,731
The pain won't stop.

35
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:46,531
Open your eyes, Ed!
Please, wake up!

36
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:48,798
[voices] Come and
die with uuuss.

37
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:49,831
Wake up!

38
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:50,731
[wincing in pain]

39
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:56,264
Ed, nooo!

40
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:03,498
[Worker] Steady,
steady...! Alright...

41
00:04:03,498 --> 00:04:04,898
[Factory hand] Oh,
this little cat?

42
00:04:04,898 --> 00:04:07,298
Yeah, I saw one that
looked just like it

43
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:08,964
by the factory earlier...

44
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:10,531
I thought it seemed
like a weird pet

45
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:12,331
for a guy in a suit
of armor to have.

46
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:14,764
Armor? Aaahh!

47
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:16,531
That thing we fought?!

48
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:19,264
[evil laughter]

49
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:21,564
That suit of armor's
gonna pay, big time!

50
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:24,731
He stole Shao May from
me...! Kidnapped her...!

51
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,364
That creep!!

52
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,431
That's her...! Shao Ma-

53
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:39,431
[Scar] Hold it.

54
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:41,298
You see that fat one?

55
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:44,431
I overheard them call
him a Homunculus.

56
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:46,298
[May Chang] A Homunculus?

57
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:49,298
He has the power to recover
from any type of injury...

58
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:51,298
So he's practically immortal.

59
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:55,564
He is...? That's even more
reason for us to go after them!

60
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:57,431
[Scar] You're
missing my point...

61
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,764
I don't know if
we can stop him.

62
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:07,664
<i>[Scar] What's the
armored boy doing with him?</i>

63
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:14,364
[May Chang shivers]

64
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:15,731
Is something wrong?

65
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:18,831
This place...
it's strange...

66
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:20,664
I could feel there
was something wrong

67
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:23,298
with this country
since I got here.

68
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:24,664
But this place...

69
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:27,331
It's the source of it...

70
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:28,898
Can you feel those things...?

71
00:05:28,898 --> 00:05:31,198
Crawling beneath us?

72
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:39,931
[Shao May whimpers]

73
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:44,864
[Al] What's the matter...?
Are you cold...? It's okay.

74
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,431
This way!

75
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:01,498
[Al] Woah...

76
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:04,764
I didn't know there were
tunnels like this under Central.

77
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:07,398
[Al gasps]

78
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,964
[Shao May whimpers]

79
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:11,264
[Al and Shao May gasp]

80
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:14,698
[Al] Hey...!
What's with all that?

81
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:19,531
Huh...? Oh... The
gatekeepers did all that.

82
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:20,831
The gatekeepers?

83
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:24,464
They won't rip you up
as long as you're with me.

84
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:30,264
[growling]

85
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,331
[Al] Just pretend
they aren't there.

86
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:36,798
[Al] Do we have
much further?

87
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:39,631
Not too far...
It's just ahead now.

88
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:41,764
[Al] You said your
father made you...

89
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:44,298
Does he know what happens
to the people you swallow?

90
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:47,798
I'm sure he does.
Father knows everything!

91
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:54,631
<i>[Al] Brother... I know you're
still alive... Just hang on.</i>

92
00:06:55,864 --> 00:07:13,731
[voices whispering]

93
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:19,694
<i>[Ed] What is that? It
looks like... a red stone.</i>

94
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:26,534
<i>It's his core... A Philosopher's
Stone... I almost forgot.</i>

95
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:30,464
<i>After all my searching...</i>

96
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:34,331
<i>It's right here...
in front of me...</i>

97
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:49,298
[Ed] Open up, Envy...!
Your breath is killing me!

98
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:51,964
I think I've got a way
to get us out of here!

99
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:53,364
[Envy and Ling gasp in surprise]

100
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:56,531
[Ed] C'mon, Envy...! Let me out!

101
00:07:57,864 --> 00:07:59,731
[roaring]

102
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:09,631
[roaring]

103
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,498
[transmutation sounds]

104
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,831
What are these things?

105
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,331
They're known as Chimeras.

106
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:24,331
[roaring]

107
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:29,698
[transmutation sounds]

108
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:36,464
[transmutation sounds]

109
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:45,964
[growling]

110
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:48,564
There's no end to them.

111
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:51,364
[May Chang] It's stronger here.

112
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,364
The feeling... There's
something evil beneath us.

113
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:56,764
[Scar] Is it more chimera?

114
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:59,498
[May Chang] No, it's worse.

115
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,631
[May Chang] Are those... people?

116
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:06,331
Father can make anything!
He made all of us, he did...!

117
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:10,664
He made me... And Lust...
And he made Envy!

118
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:26,498
[Father] The gatekeepers
seem to have grown restless.

119
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,998
[Father] Someone's
come to find me.

120
00:09:28,998 --> 00:09:31,498
<i>[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

121
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:37,384
<i>[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

122
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,418
[Crying babies]

123
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:39,977
[Bradley] I have no memory
of my parents' faces

124
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,210
or their names...

125
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,810
In fact, I don't even
remember my own name.

126
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,344
For all I know, I might
have been abandoned

127
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:51,077
or sold before I even had one.

128
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:53,110
[Scientist] Now which one of
you will be the one to step

129
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,077
forward and lead this country?

130
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:59,244
How 'bout you?

131
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:01,310
[Bradley] They called us
"prospective Fuhrers"...

132
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,944
And they trained
us to be leaders.

133
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:05,410
They kept us
confined together...

134
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,844
and they taught us at all
times of the day and night.

135
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:12,077
We studied political
science, and humanities...

136
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:14,277
As well as martial
arts... firearms...

137
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:16,844
and of course, swordsmanship.

138
00:10:16,844 --> 00:10:22,777
[swords clanging, grunting]

139
00:10:22,777 --> 00:10:25,444
[yelling in pain]

140
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:32,544
[whimpering]

141
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:35,477
Don't worry... His only
true purpose in life

142
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:38,910
was to help you further
achieve your goal.

143
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,110
[Bradley] I was certain that
I would be the one chosen

144
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,944
to lead this country.
I firmly believed it

145
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,910
and I endured any
training to make it so.

146
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,277
[transmutation sounds,
screaming]

147
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:57,544
[Scientist] How disappointing.
Another failure.

148
00:10:57,544 --> 00:10:58,844
[Scientist] Bring the next.

149
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:04,910
[Scientist] Go ahead
and lie down.

150
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,377
What's going on here?

151
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:13,077
[Scientist] Just try
not to think about it.

152
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:15,244
This won't take long.

153
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,244
What are you gonna do
to me...?.! Are they dead?!

154
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:28,377
[Father] You are the
twelfth candidate.

155
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:33,777
Do you have what it takes to
become my fury? My Wrath?

156
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:39,410
[Bradley] A Philosopher's Stone
is created from the life force

157
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,244
of countless human beings
and contains their souls.

158
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,110
Once injected into the
bloodstream, it begins to

159
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,244
take over its new host and the
human body tries to reject it.

160
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,944
My body was repeatedly
destroyed from the inside out

161
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:57,510
and then rebuilt by the stone.

162
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,244
The only options I had were to
die or to overcome its power.

163
00:12:02,244 --> 00:12:04,044
I chose the latter.

164
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:05,377
[Scientist] It's amazing!

165
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:07,777
We've made a new type of human!

166
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:11,410
Congratulations. You have
been chosen to lead mankind

167
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,510
down the path of destiny...

168
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,944
Everything has been arranged

169
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:18,077
to provide you with
all that you'll need.

170
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:20,377
From now on, your
name will be...

171
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:22,744
King Bradley.

172
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,777
[Bradley] Countless
souls had battled

173
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:27,510
for dominance within me.

174
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,844
And only the most
wrathful one survived.

175
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:33,010
I can't tell you if
this remaining soul

176
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,544
was one of those within the
Philosopher's Stone...

177
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:39,044
Or if it's the one I'd
carried since I was born...

178
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:44,244
I doubt that I'll ever know.

179
00:12:44,244 --> 00:12:46,344
You've lived your life
before as a human being...

180
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:49,144
Why choose to be a
Homunculus, sir...?

181
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,077
Isn't there some way you could
go back to being a human...?

182
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:54,110
Or not?

183
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,110
You suggest I become human
again...? Ridiculous...

184
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,177
Why would I possibly want
to pursue such frivolity?

185
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:04,977
[Bradley] I've become
something far superior.

186
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:08,110
Just as you humans take great
pride in your "humanity",

187
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,444
misguided though that may
be... I too am proud...

188
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:14,444
Because we also take
pride in what we are.

189
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:16,310
The woman you killed.

190
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:22,310
She died with her pride
intact, didn't she?

191
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,177
There. That should help.

192
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,410
Thank you, Ling.

193
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,510
[crashing]

194
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,177
[Envy] I collected all the
fragments that I could find.

195
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,544
[Ling] So this stuff...
It's all from Xerxes?

196
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:37,110
That's right... They're
pieces of a large mural

197
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,010
from what remains
of their temple.

198
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,344
[Ed] When I saw the ruins
of the mural up close...

199
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:45,244
I thought it was identical
to the transmutation circle

200
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:46,344
from the 5th Laboratory.

201
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:49,877
The one they used to create
Philosopher's Stones.

202
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,877
But it's actually different.

203
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:53,777
The sun represents the soul.

204
00:13:53,777 --> 00:13:56,110
While the moon
symbolizes the mind.

205
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,910
And then there's the stone
canvas of the mural...

206
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,010
This represents the body.

207
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,977
Slow down... Try to
keep it simple, okay?

208
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,244
Basically... The mural
was a summoning circle...

209
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:10,244
For human transmutation.

210
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:13,110
I do know that one...
Well I think I do...

211
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,977
Is it used to bring
back dead people?

212
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:16,510
Not quite.

213
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,377
[Ed] Alchemy is based on the
rule of equivalent exchange...

214
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:21,844
You can't transmute a
life form from a soul

215
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:24,244
that no longer exists
in this world.

216
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:27,244
You can trust me on that one.

217
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:30,810
So... this is where I got the
idea to get us out of here.

218
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,510
I can't transmute the dead...

219
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,810
but what would happen
if I transmute myself?

220
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,244
You mean a living person?

221
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,177
Exactly... I can use this
transmutation circle

222
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:42,777
to deconstruct myself...

223
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:45,244
And then I'll just put
myself back together...

224
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:50,110
That's human transmutation...
and it'll open the portal.

225
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,844
[Ed] You said that Gluttony is
a defective Portal of Truth...

226
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:55,910
I'll bet that if we pass
through the real portal,

227
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,510
then we'll wind up
in our own reality.

228
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,377
I'll open up the real portal...

229
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:03,277
and then you two
jump through it.

230
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,444
What happens if it goes wrong?

231
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:06,844
Then it'll rebound...

232
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:08,877
A failed transmutation ricochets

233
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:10,477
onto the one who
performed it...

234
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,244
[Ed] In this case,
that would be me.

235
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:16,477
I'm not gonna act like I know
anything about alchemy...

236
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:18,077
This is all yours.

237
00:15:18,077 --> 00:15:21,077
Right... Hey, Envy...

238
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:23,677
I've got something else
that I wanted to ask you.

239
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:30,010
[Ed] The partial mural
I saw in Xerxes...

240
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,244
It would've looked
more-or-less like this.

241
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:35,244
This is the first thing
that caught my eye...

242
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:38,277
The symbol for God is
written upside-down...

243
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:40,810
And beneath it is the
two-headed dragon...

244
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,044
The alchemic symbol for
a "complete lifeform".

245
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,944
Which means... This
basically translates to

246
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:51,244
"I will strike God to Earth
and become a perfect being".

247
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:53,977
Well that's certainly
an arrogant concept.

248
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,777
It's not a big deal
to talk about it...

249
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:58,377
but then there's this.

250
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:00,977
[Ed] This piece takes
it to the next level.

251
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:03,844
An image of the lion
swallowing the sun...

252
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:07,477
Symbolizing the
Philosopher's Stone.

253
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:10,586
The Philosopher's Stone is
made with living humans...

254
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,186
Isn't that correct, Envy?

255
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:15,119
Yeah... That's right.

256
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:18,052
[Ed] How could a nation as
advanced as Xerxes fall...?

257
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:20,519
Let alone in a single night?

258
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,686
What happened to
its citizens...?

259
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:24,652
These stone fragments
of the mural...

260
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:28,119
You put them here
to hide the evidence.

261
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:32,152
You killed them... You
sacrificed all of Xerxes...

262
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:34,686
You turned them into a
Philosopher's Stone!

263
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:47,719
[transmutation sounds,
screaming]

264
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,186
Who was it?!

265
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:52,119
[Ed] I wanna know who used
this to transmute himself...!

266
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:54,786
Who slaughtered the population
of a whole country...

267
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:57,686
Who created all of you...?
Who's trying to make himself

268
00:16:57,686 --> 00:17:00,086
powerful enough to surpass God!

269
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,452
It was your father...?
Wasn't it? Tell me, Envy...

270
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:06,019
Whoever this guy is, he's
been using you Homunculi

271
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:08,552
to try and recreate the
destruction of Xerxes

272
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:10,886
here in Amestris, hasn't he?!

273
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:16,019
You get us out of here and
I'll gladly tell you everything.

274
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:18,552
You've spent enough time
beating around the bush...

275
00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:20,752
I'm tired of waiting
for you to ask...

276
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:24,924
You need to pay a toll,
right...? To open the Portal?

277
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,586
[Envy] This should work.

278
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,886
[voices screaming]

279
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:39,952
Your body... Those are the
citizens of Xerxes, aren't they?

280
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:43,952
At one time, but their minds and
bodies crumbled long ago...

281
00:17:43,952 --> 00:17:47,119
All that's left is energy
to be consumed.

282
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,019
They don't even remember
what they looked like

283
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:51,019
when they were alive.

284
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:54,519
Is that pity...? How
childish are you?

285
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:57,586
You're desperate to see these
things as human because you

286
00:17:57,586 --> 00:18:01,819
wanna believe that your brother
still retains his humanity.

287
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:05,419
Would you hesitate to throw a
bundle of logs onto a fire...

288
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,152
because you pitied the
tree they came from?

289
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:11,952
These souls can never go
back to being human.

290
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:16,519
You have to use logic if you are
to determine what a human is.

291
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,486
Don't let your emotions decide.

292
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:27,880
[Ed] Alright.

293
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,714
Ling... This might not
work out for me...

294
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:35,147
If so, you gotta warn people
about these guys' plans.

295
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:39,047
I'm not that concerned about
Amestris. It's not my country.

296
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:42,614
Are you serious?

297
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:45,214
You've got people you love
waiting for you, don't you?

298
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:47,047
So just make it back alive

299
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:48,814
and tell them yourself.

300
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,147
I'm sorry... But
I need to use you.

301
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Get ready!

302
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:09,580
<i>[Ling] That pose he makes
when he transmutes...</i>

303
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,614

me of something.</i>

304
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:12,780

Long time no see.

308
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,014
Too bad this isn't why I'd
planned on opening you again.

309
00:19:32,014 --> 00:19:36,047
Ling...! Jump in it!

310
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:39,180
You better know what you're
doing...! I'm trusting you!

311
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,880
<i>[Ling] It's exactly like when
Gluttony swallowed us!</i>

312

<i>Thank you.</i>

You're not even trying to get
your body back, are you?

323
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,580
[Al] So this is it...? Your
father's on the other side?

[Ed] Al! Come on! Please...!
Hurry, Al! Aaaaall!

333
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:43,280
I can't.

334
