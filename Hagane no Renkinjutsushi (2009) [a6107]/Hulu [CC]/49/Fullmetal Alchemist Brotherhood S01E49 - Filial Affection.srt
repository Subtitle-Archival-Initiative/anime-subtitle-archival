a fact that these guys

abandon us.

Where'd the old
guy head off to?

354
00:19:12,722 --> 00:19:15,055
He's gonna do
some recon in Central.

355
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:16,455
By himself?

356
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,588
Yeah...
He pointed out

357
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:20,555
that he's the only one who's
kept his identity hidden...

358
00:19:20,555 --> 00:19:23,555
So it'll be easier for him
to infiltrate the city.

359
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:26,855

He also said that he'd
do his best to update us

360
00:19:26,855 --> 00:19:28,955
on Colonel Mustang's actions.

361
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:31,088
But I'm kind of
getting the feeling that

362
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,188
he's mostly
concerned about Ling.

363
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,455
Sure... That
makes sense.

364
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:37,055
So you're all finished
discussing things

365
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:38,755
with Scar
and the others?

366
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:39,955

out our strategy.

late as you think it is...
