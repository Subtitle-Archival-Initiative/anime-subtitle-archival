1
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:43,513
This place is like a maze.

2
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:45,279
Try not to get separated.

3
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,679
All right.

4
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:50,146
Gahhh!

5
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:52,179
- [WINRY] Owww.
- Winry! Are you okay?

6
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,179
[WINRY]
I'm fine.

7
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,013
What's this stuff?

8
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:01,546
Dynamite!

9
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:03,579
Take it from me, take it
from me, take it from me...!

10
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:06,279
Nahhhh. These are
all sopping wet...

11
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,613
Relax. They wouldn't blow up

12
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:10,546
even if we wanted 'em to.

13
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:13,279
Enough... Quit dawdling...

14
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:15,413
They could already be after us.

15
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:17,179
Right... Sorry.

16
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:26,827
[MILES]
The storm has finally passed.

17
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:28,461
Start preparing.

18
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:29,927
[MICK and LIAM]
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:32,594
We can't take any risks

20
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:33,927
with Kimblee and his men,

21
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:35,627
so first chance you get...

22
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:38,694
take out all three of them.

23
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:40,661
[LIAM] Right. Yes, sir.
[MICK] Understood, sir.

24
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:58,327
You're the only ones to
know of this mission...

25
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:01,394
Don't mention it
outside of this room.

26
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:02,761
Hey, hold on a minute...

27
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:05,427
You're not planning on
killing them, are you Major?

28
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:06,961
Of course we are.

29
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:09,494
No, I'm not gonna
have any part of that...

30
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:10,961
I say we should
take Kimblee prisoner

31
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,561
and try to get some answers.

32
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,894
[MILES] Do you really think
he'll tell us anything...?

33
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,861
He's too dangerous to live.

34
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:18,927
But we don't know
about his men.

35
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:19,861
I mean for all we know,

36
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:21,994
he could be
manipulating them somehow...

37
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,061
Forcing
them to obey.

38
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:25,061
You could be right...

39
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:28,661
But we can't take such
a risk on a possibility.

40
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:31,027
And yet you're still
willing to kill them for one...

41
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:33,494
This isn't like it was
with General Raven...

42
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:34,494
There might be another way!

43
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:37,027
Have you forgotten the
first law of Briggs...?

44
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:39,594
The careless are
the first to die.

45
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,461
You show mercy in this place...

46
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:43,494
And I guarantee that
it's going to get you

47
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:45,761
or your friends killed.

48
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,961
[MILES]
We aren't going to be careless.

49
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:53,561
We're killing Kimblee...

50
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:55,661
And the two men with him.

51
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:02,561
I had almost forgotten
that he's just a kid.

52
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:03,761
Indeed he is...

53
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:05,427
Especially if he's naÃ ̄ve enough

54
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:07,727
to think he won't
have to kill anyone.

55
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:11,661
Well I have to admit that
I used to think the same thing.

56
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:13,394
So did I.

57
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:15,027
But once you've lived
through a couple wars

58
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:17,694
ike we have, you
learn some things...

59
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:18,761
Like sometimes,

60
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:22,027
killing someone isn't as
hard as letting them live.

61
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,294
The Elric brothers
have certainly chosen

62
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:26,994
the more difficult path.

63
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,294
[MILES] I guess they like
to go against the grain.

64
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:30,194
Yeah...

65
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:32,827
But in a way, I envy
their conviction.

66
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:42,994
[MARCOH] What's this
"Rasayana" term here?

67
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:46,627
[SCAR] It's a miracle
drug used for longevity.

68
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:49,027
[MARCOH] Could that be the
Philosopher's Stone...?

69
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:51,761
It says here...
that it can transform...

70
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:55,727
all metals into gold and
restore youth to the elderly...

71
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:58,427
And what does this term
mean...? "Aurelian"?

72
00:04:58,427 --> 00:04:59,994
[SCAR]
It's another term for gold.

73
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:01,527
[MARCOH] So these
notes are centered around

74
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,627
immortality and gold.

75
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:05,761
I'm guessing that it's
because Mr. Scar's brother was

76
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:09,627
influenced by Xingese alkahestry
whenever he wrote them.

77
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:11,294
And why is that?

78
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:13,961
We refer to an
immortal as a shinhito...

79
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:15,861
It means a "a true being"...

80
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:18,894
These "true beings" are
considered to be perfect souls.

81
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,661
And since gold is
considered the perfect metal...

82
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:24,594
these beings are also
sometimes called "Aurelian."

83
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,027
[MARCOH]
So in other words...

84
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,794
An immortal person is
seen as a "golden being."

85
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:33,361
[MAY CHANG]
In a sense.

86
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:36,361
It comes from the man who
brought alchemy to Xing...

87
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:37,894
The legend says
he was an immortal

88
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,761
with golden hair and eyes.

89
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:43,561
And that's where the
term first originated.

90
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:46,427
An alchemist with golden
hair and golden eyes, huh...

91
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:48,694
Sounds like Ed and Al.

92
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:51,761
[YOKI]
Hey...! Over here...! The exit!

93
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:01,627
Oh, wow...! It's so bright!

94
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,027
[MARCOH] I was starting
to wonder if we'd make it.

95
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:05,527
[GERSO]
The weather's clear.

96
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,494
[ZAMPANO]
For now...

97
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:08,061
Let's head to Briggs
before it turns again.

98
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:09,494
Alright, everyone...

99
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,761
Follow my lea--

100
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:12,727
[YOKI]
Hey...!

101
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:13,427
[GERSO] Looks like the
snow is pretty deep.

102
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:14,894
You should hop on my back Miss,

103
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:15,827
just to be safe.

104
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:18,394
We'll walk ahead to
stomp down the snow

105
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:20,494
and make a clear path for
the rest of you to follow.

106
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:22,327
Thank you very much.

107
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:33,494
[AL]
Helllllp!

108
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,894
Hey...! Is someone there...?!

109
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,627
Help me, please!

110
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:39,394
Help!

111
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:40,661
That's Al!

112
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,061
My Alphonse?!

113
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:43,161
[MAY CHANG]
No, no!

114
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:47,027
[WINRY] Just hold on,
we'll get you out of there!

115
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:48,694
[AL]
You saved me!

116
00:06:48,694 --> 00:06:49,894
I got stuck in the snow...

117
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:51,794
And then a blizzard buried me.

118
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:54,661
[WINRY]
What are you doing out here, Al?

119
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,894
[AL] I crossed the
mountain to warn you guys.

120
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:58,627
You crossed over...?

121
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,827
In the middle of that snowstorm?

122
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,527
[YOKI]
So you cut straight through

123
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:07,361
bypassing the mine's
twists and turns.

124
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,427
[MARCOH]
Why would you even risk that?

125
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,394
[AL] It was the
only way to warn you.

126
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:13,594
[WINRY]
Warn us about what?

127
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:16,727
[AL] Briggs has been taken
over by troops from Central.

128
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:20,294
General Armstrong's gone.

129
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:22,627
They summoned her to
Central Headquarters.

130
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:24,294
You'll be walking
right into their hands

131
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:25,794
if you go there.

132
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:29,327
[GERSO] Well, then what
are we supposed to do...?

133
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,761
We can't just hide in the mines.

134
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:33,061
[AL]
I don't know...

135
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,894
We'll have to
find someplace else.

136
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:37,527
But there isn't anyplace else!

137
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,294
Just follow me.

138
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:45,761
[MARCOH]
Where are you taking us?

139
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:48,061
There's a mountain
village called Asbeck nearby.

140
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:50,761
It shouldn't take
us long to get there.

141
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,561
I have been told
that some of my people

142
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:55,361
have taken refuge
in the slums there.

143
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:57,361
An Ishvalan refugee camp?

144
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,994
It's not like we really
have any other options.

145
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:02,927
Great idea, sir...!
Let's get going!

146
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:08,827
Are you sure about this, Al?

147
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:09,794
[AL]
About what?

148
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:11,694
Well, isn't Mr. Kimblee
gonna be suspicious

149
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:13,961
if you just suddenly disappear?

150
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,794
[AL]
It's okay, don't worry.

151
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:18,261
Brother's got it
all taken care of.

152
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:20,594
[SOLDIER A]
Three men in this squad.

153
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:22,927
[SOLDIER B]
There are five men in mine, sir.

154
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,894
Each squad is ready then...

155
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:28,461
Spread out and carefully
search your designated sector.

156
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,094
[SOLDIER B]
Sir.

157
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:30,394
[SOLDIER A]
Yes, sir.

158
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,494
Let's get going.

159
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:36,794
[MICK]
Yes, sir.

160
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:38,994
Don't get carried
away, Alphonse.

161
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:42,027
There's no reason to
call the Major "sir."

162
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:44,761
It's hard to move
around in here...

163
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:47,027
Couldn't you have
made this thing lighter?

164
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,427
[ED] You're strong,
you can handle it...

165
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:52,627
C'mon... Kimblee's watching.

166
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:53,961
[MICK]
Hold on, Brother!

167
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,794
[ED]
Hurry up... c'mon.

168
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:06,527
Did you overhear Kimblee say
where his squad is searching?

169
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:09,727
You saw that mineshaft in
the center of town, didn't you?

170
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:11,027
They're headed down there...

171
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,661
To search the tunnels.

172
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:15,827
I heard him mention
that he couldn't trust

173
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,061
the Northern soldiers,

174
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:21,494
so he's only taking the men
that he brought with him, sir.

175
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,927
[MILES] I guess he's
figured us out, then.

176
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:25,061
We'll head them off...

177
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:27,961
Position snipers near the
opening of the mine shaft.

178
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,594
Yes, Sir.

179
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:41,294
[KIMBLEE] Check the entrance
for tracks in the snow...

180
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:43,861
We'll follow them in if
you find multiple sets.

181
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:45,394
[DARIUS and HEINKEL]
Yes, sir.

182
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:50,361
[MILES]
Is it clear?

183
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:53,027
[MICK]
Yes, sir... He's in my sights.

184
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:58,761
[MILES]
What's wrong?

185
00:09:58,761 --> 00:09:59,961
[MICK]
It's Edward.

186
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:01,594
[MILES]
What?

187
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:07,994
Hey, Kimblee...

188
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:09,827
You should probably
let the Briggs soldiers

189
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:11,827
check the tunnels instead...

190
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:14,994
You could get lost in
there pretty easily.

191
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,694
The mere fact that
you're stopping me

192
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:18,494
is proof that we're
in the right place...

193
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:20,527
Now I know that
they're down there.

194
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:22,561
And how is that...?

195
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:23,794
Look, I wanna
catch Scar just as--

196
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:24,994
You're trying to buy some time

197
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:27,027
for your snipers to
get into position,

198
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,494
aren't you?

199
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:31,361
You knew about that?

200
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:33,561
I can practically smell
the murderous intent

201
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,361
in the air around here...

202
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:38,761
It's like a sixth sense
I picked up while in Ishval.

203
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:41,027
They're just standing
there, talking...

204
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:42,761
What should I do?

205
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:44,894
Can you still target Kimblee?

206
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,294
[MICK]
Yes, sir.

207
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:48,961
[MILES]
Then aim carefully... and fire.

208
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:50,594
[MICK]
Yes, sir.

209
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:01,394
[MICK]
That bastard!

210
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,327
He's using the snow
to block our view!

211
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:04,727
[ED]
Dammit.

212
00:11:06,694 --> 00:11:08,294

214
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,061
[ED] I should've guessed
you guys were chimeras!

217
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:08,232
[ED]
Damn you, Kimblee.

218
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:10,265
I can't see anything...

219
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:12,965
But on the bright side,
they can't see me either.

220
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,065
The odds are eve--

221
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:16,965
[HEINKEL] There's no
point in trying to run,

222
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:19,299
Fullmetal Alchemist.

223
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:21,132
You can't hide from us here...

224
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:23,965
We may not see you,
but we can smell you.

225
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:25,399

Shut up.

00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:41,199

Major Miles!

230
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:44,799
These guys are Chimeras!

231
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,432
And they know how to
fight in low visibility.

232
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,332
Stay outta here...! Trust me!

233
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:01,332
[ED]
Owwww...

234
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:04,332
Falling like that's gonna
stunt my growth even more.

235
00:13:07,265 --> 00:13:08,465
[ED]
Dynamite, huh?

236
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:11,099
There's one perk to
fighting in a mine.

237
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,899
Whoa, you might want to
keep your distance guys.

238
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:20,199
These aren't exactly
cigars I'm holding.

239
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,465
[HEINKEL]
You idiot.

240
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:24,199
[DARIUS] That stuff isn't gonna
do you any good, it's too damp.

241
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:25,199
[ED]
You sure about that...?

242
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:28,932
Do you happen to know
what dynamite's made of?

243
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,499
It's Nitroglycerin, isn't it?

244
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:32,199
And Nitroglycol...

245
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:33,999
And there's sawdust...

246
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,032
Isn't there ammonium
nitrate in it too?

247
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,832
[ED]
Yeeess, there is.

248
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:40,165
And what's ammonium
nitrate made out of?

249
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,165
[HEINKEL] That's easy!
Nitric acid and ammonia.

250
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:48,399
[HEINKEL and DARIUS]
Ammoniaaaa!

251
00:13:50,232 --> 00:13:52,232
[HEINKEL and DARIUS]
Pee-yew!

252
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:01,165
[KIMBLEE]
What's that disgusing smell?!

253
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,765
[ED]
That's ammonia...

254
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:05,465
There're downsides to
having a sharp nose...

255
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:07,699
I doubt that they'll be
much use to you now.

256
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:11,799
Your attitude changed
rather quickly,

257
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,465
now that I've lost my hostage.

258
00:14:13,465 --> 00:14:15,732
What'd you expect to happen?

259
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:16,999
Let's make this easy.

260
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:20,365
All I want here is for you to
tell me everything you know...

261
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:23,032
[KIMBLEE] Oh, is that
all you want from me...?

262
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:24,365
I just got out of the hospital

263
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:26,932
and I don't feel like
getting banged up fighting

264
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,132
a youngster like you...

265
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:31,365
Not to mention that I don't
really have the time either.

266
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:35,932
I guess I'll have to
speed things up with this.

<i>[ED] At least I won't
have to search for it now.</i>

00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:04,865
[KIMBLEE]
Now you've what?

274
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:06,965
You think you've won?

275
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:09,265
So you're determined
not to kill...

276
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:11,099
How admirable of you...

277
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:12,499
You do realize the advantage

278
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:14,032
that it gives your
opponent though,

279
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:15,799
now don't you?

280
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,732
Instead of finishing me off,

281
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:20,732
you've given me a
second chance to kill you.

282
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:27,832
That sense of mercy is about
to get you in a lot of trouble.

00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,032

It's pulling my soul.

00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,875
What made you
decide to rescue us?

00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,009
[HEINKEL]
You're more injured than we are.

317
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:32,609
[ED]
Don't get the wrong idea.

318
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:35,842
I can't pull this out of
my stomach on my own...

319
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:38,909
I could use...
a little bit of help.

320
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,109
[DARIUS] We were enemies
just five minutes ago

321
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:43,942
and now you're asking
us to save your life.

322
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:46,575
[ED]
Yeah... Basically.

323
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:51,642
[DARIUS] Well...

324
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:54,275
It's not like we were
given orders to kill you.

325
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,275
C'mon.

326
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:57,242
[HEINKEL]
Y'know, kid...

327
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:59,275
You're gonna bleed to
death pretty quickly

328
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:01,009
once I pull this out.

329
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:03,175
Not if I heal it...

330
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,675
As soon as it's out of me,

331
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:06,642
I'll close up the wound...

332
00:19:06,642 --> 00:19:08,009
with alchemy.

333
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:09,242
[HEINKEL]
What?

334
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:12,275
Have you ever performed any
kind of medical alchemy before?

335
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:17,009
Sort of... I did
some research on it...

336
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:19,575
when I tried
human transmutation.

337
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,209
Just some research...?

338
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:23,709
Your guts've gotta
be all messed up...

339
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,642
You're gonna need a
Philosopher's Stone

340
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,642
to make this work.

341
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:30,575
I'm gonna have to use
my own life force...

342
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:32,975
the same way
I would use a stone.

343
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:38,175
It'll probably take a few
years off my lifespan, though.

344
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:39,209
[HEINKEL]
You're positive?

345
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:42,275
I don't really have
time to think about it...

346
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:45,242
If this is really what
showing mercy is gonna cost me,

347
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:48,909
then I'm gonna have to learn
to pay the price... right?

348
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:52,842
I don't know what
you're talkin' about,

349
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:54,909
but it sounds like you're sure.

350
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,175
[HEINKEL]
Ready?

351
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:06,042
Yeah, I'm ready.

352
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:08,042
<i>[ED]
I've gotta picture myself...</i>

353
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,575
<i>as a single mass of energy.</i>

354
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:15,975
[painfully]
Yaahhh!! Rghhh!!

355
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:17,109
<i>[ED]
Use the energy...</i>

356
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:19,009
<i>Just like the Stone!</i>

357
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,009
[painfully]
Rrrrghh!! Yaaggghh!!

358
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:23,242
<i>[ED]
That's it...</i>

359
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:27,109
<i>I'm a Philosopher's Stone</i>
that's powered by a single soul.

360
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:32,142
[painfully]
Aaaaaaaaagggh!!!

361
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:33,242
<i>[ED]
Remember...</i>

362
00:20:33,242 --> 00:20:35,009
<i>What it felt like...</i>

363
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:37,575
<i>At that moment.</i>

364
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,242
<i>Remember...</i>

365
00:20:39,242 --> 00:20:42,009
<i>How it felt to use souls!</i>

366
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,742
<i>To harness liiiife!</i>

367
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:04,809
[HEINKEL]
Did he make it?

368
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:09,175
Ya can't kill me that easily.

369
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:11,575
Whoa... You mean it worked!?

370
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:14,575
Well, I wouldn't exactly
say that I'm healed...

371
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:17,675
I rejoined my
undamaged organs...

372
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:20,675
And I managed to
stop the bleeding...

373
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:22,809
But it won't last for long.

374
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:25,142
[HEINKEL] Oh... Then
you need a real doctor.

375
00:21:25,142 --> 00:21:28,975
No... I don't have
time... for that.

376
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,809
[DARIUS]
What...? Hey!

377
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:34,209
[ED] I've gotta stop Kimblee...
Before he gets...

378
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,809
to... them...

379
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:40,675
[DARIUS]
Oh, man.

380
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:41,842
[HEINKEL]
Idiot...

381
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,075
There's no way you can fight
Kimblee in your condition.

382
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,142
What is it?

383
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:52,275
[HEINKEL]
Whoa...

384
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,709
The Stone, huh...?

385
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:56,009
I guess Mr. Kimblee
must've lost it.

386
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:57,875
Quit callin' that
freak "Mister"...

387
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,275
He's not our boss...

388
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:01,542
Not since he almost killed us.

389
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:02,875
That's a good point...

390
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,709
How about we make our
resignation official?

391
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,275
Let's just hold
onto our freedom

392
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:11,209
and let the bastard think
we died in the rubble.

393
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:15,209
Well... What do we do with him?

394
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,709
[HEINKEL] We can't just
leave him here to die.

395
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:20,875
We do owe him
our lives, after all.

396
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:24,775
[DARIUS] Very true...
First things first...

397
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:26,609
We gotta find him a doctor.

398
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:28,042
[HEINKEL]
Right.

399
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:06,942
<i>[NARRATOR] The situation
may seem to be unstoppable,</i>

400
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:09,142
<i>but the unexpected
lies in wait,</i>

401
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:13,009
<i>planning to forge its own
path and alter the outcome.</i>

402
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,742

403
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:17,142

00:24:17,142 --> 00:24:20,109
