1
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,752
[Ed] Hello...?
Can anyone hear me?!

2
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:39,352
[Water sloshing]

3
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:42,352
Hello...?! Anybody?!

4
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:46,386
What the hell is this
place...?! Damn it.

5
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:49,452
It's Ling's fault...!
That idiot prince!

6
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,986
[Ling] Who do you think
you are to call me that?

7
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:54,119
[Ed] Ling?!

8
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,919
You can't call the future
emperor of a nation an idiot.

9
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:59,119
Are you alright?

10
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,852
[Ed] Hold on...

11
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:04,152
[Ling] What's wrong?

12
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:07,052
How do I know you're
not Envy in disguise?

13
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:08,952
Oh, Come on...

14
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:09,952
Do you want me to recite

15
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:12,786
the hotel room service
menu from top to bottom?

16
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:14,452
Alright... You're Ling.

17
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:17,452
And what about you? How
do I know you're not Envy...?

18
00:02:17,452 --> 00:02:18,452
You little ru--

19
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:20,452
Who're you calling
a little runt, you jerk?!

20
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:22,952
Okay, it's really you.

21
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:30,819
[Ed] How did we even get here?

22
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:36,052
[Ling] Last thing I remember?
Gluttony swallowed us whole.

23
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:38,286
So you think
this cavernous void

24
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:40,186
is the inside of
Gluttony's stomach?

25
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:45,086
Most likely...
Look. There.

26
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:47,986
[Ling] That's the abandoned
house where we were hiding...

27
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:51,052
Also, check this out.

28
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,786
And that's the lieutenant's car.

29
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,286
[Ling] And I'm
guessing all the fire

30
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:57,786
is from the Colonel's attack.

31
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,786
[Ed] Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:04,152
That proves it... But how could
Gluttony's belly be this huge?

33
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:05,919
I have no idea...

34
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,752
but I sincerely doubt
this is a very pleasant place.

35
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:10,186
Gimme that.

36
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:12,219
[Ling] What is it?

37
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:18,252
Ling... look at this.

38
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:20,186
Is that Al's?

39
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:22,719
Why is it just his hand...?

40
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,719
Maybe he didn't get
swallowed... Then he's safe.

41
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,819
He's gotta be freaking out
wondering where we are now...

42
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,919
I wish there was some
way I could contact him.

43
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,719
[Ed cries out] Ahhhhhhhh!!!

44
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,452
Conveniently awaken,
telepathic powers...!

45
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:43,852
Elric brother telepathy!

46
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:45,319
[Ling] Yeah, good
luck with that.

47
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,352
[Ed] Come in, brother! Come in!

48
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,786
[Ed] This place
is like a wasteland

49
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:54,086
of buildings and
human remains...

50
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:55,786
but they're all from
different time periods.

51
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:57,052
[Ling] I'm starting to wonder

52
00:03:57,052 --> 00:03:58,386
if there's even
a way out of here.

53
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:00,786
If not... then I'll make us one.

54
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:03,952
You will, will you...?
How and where?

55
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:08,319
Okay, now drop the torch.

56
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,986
Oh, I get it now.

57
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,752
Here goes.

58
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:22,019
We should have heard
it land by now, right?

59
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,119
[Ling] A wall...!
There has to be a wall!

60
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,452
[Ed] There has to be...!

61
00:04:25,452 --> 00:04:27,252
No matter how
huge this place is,

62
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:29,852
if we keep heading straight
we're gonna reach the edge!

63
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,352
There's gotta be some
kind of exit somewhere!

64
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:36,919
I still haven't found her yet.

65
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:40,186
Where is she?

66
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:43,252
It isn't like her to just
disappear like this.

67
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:46,119
Maybe she got eaten by
a stray dog or something.

68
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,919
Eaten?

69
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,052
[May Chang cries]

70
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:51,719
I was just joking!

71
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:53,352
[May Chang] She's not a cat.

72
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:56,219
[May Change] She's actually
a panda, but she got a disease

73
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:59,819
when she was a baby and it kept
her from growing all the way...

74
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,452
I nursed her back to health
after her mother abandoned her.

75
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:07,219
Since then... She's been
almost like a sister to me.

76
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:10,819
[May Chang] My family,
the Chang Clan,

77
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,486
is one of the
lowest ranked houses

78
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:15,786
out of the fifty clans that
make up the Xing empire.

79
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:18,352
We have little
to no power at all.

80
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:23,119
Maybe that's why
I was drawn to her.

81
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:25,086
She looked so
helpless and weak,

82
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:27,786
I couldn't help but
identify with her.

83
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,052
[May Chang sighs]

84
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,452
But at the time,

85
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:34,052
I guess I just took pity
on her more than anything.

86
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:37,252
[Shao May mewls]

87
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:38,452
[Shao May growls]

88
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,752
[May Chang screams in pain]

89
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:43,052
[Shao May whimpers in sleep]

90
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,919
[May Chang] But that changed...

91
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,186
And she became a
part of my family...

92
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:49,886
We've been through
so much together.

93
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,986
She's always been with me...

94
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:54,919
It feels so wrong not
having her here now.

95
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:02,186
I don't think I could have
gone through everything I have

96
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:04,186
without Shao May by my side...

97
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:06,219
I know for a fact that
I couldn't have made it

98
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:07,886
across the desert without her.

99
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:11,086
[Yoki] Sure... but that was
a pointless endeavor anyway.

100
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:13,019
Why would you risk your life

101
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,319
like that for something as
preposterous as immortality?

102
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,386
Because it's the last
hope that my clan has...

103
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:21,286
If I don't return with a
method for attaining immortality

104
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:22,752
and present it to the emperor,

105
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:26,186
it's almost certain
my clan will perish...

106
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,219
That's why I risked my
life crossing the desert...

107
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:31,419
With Shao May.

108
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:32,552
[May Chang cries]
[Yoki] Ahhh!

109
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:35,386
[Yoki] C'mon, cut it out!
You're gonna drown us all!

110
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:36,052
[Yoki cries out in pain]

111
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:37,952
[Crash]

112
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:45,052
[May Chang continues to cry]
[Yoki whimpers in pain]

113
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:46,752
[Yoki] Sir?

114
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:49,219
[Scar] We've got some time
before the sun comes up.

115
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:52,686
There won't be as many guards
patrolling the streets.

116
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:57,186
You mean you're gonna
help me try to find her?

117
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,986
[May Chang] He's a good person.

118
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:03,152
His people were
completely wiped out

119
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:05,786
during the civil
war a few years ago.

120
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:07,486
That's right.

121
00:07:07,486 --> 00:07:09,919
[Yoki] He knows a
thing or two about loss...

122
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,152
So I'm sure he can
identify with your worries

123
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:14,186
about the fate of your clan.

124
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:18,719
[Scar] What's the hold
up...? You coming or not?

125
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,786
Yeah! Let's go!

126
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:23,152
[May Chang laughs]

127
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,412
[Water sloshing]

128
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:28,852
This is really
starting to get old...

129
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:31,219
Blood doesn't make
for good terrain.

130
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:37,052
I noticed... And we're still
not any closer to an exit.

131
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:39,452
[Ling] I'm starving to death.

132
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:43,119
[Ed] Soon as we're out...

133
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,886
I'll let you order
anything from room service...

134
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:48,452
And you can eat as
much as you want...

135
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:50,886
And sleep as long as you like.

136
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:52,786
[Loud splash]

137
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,452
Ling?

138
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:57,052
I can't make it.

139
00:07:57,052 --> 00:08:00,286
Don't tell me... you're
really givin' up so soon?

140
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:01,952
[Ed] Are you that pathetic?

141
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:04,786
It's bad enough when
you collapse in the street,

142
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:07,852
but here?! Get up...! Come on!

143
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:10,786
Quit being so weak!

144
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:13,186
Just go.

145
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:16,986
[Ed] You spineless jellyfish...!
Alright, fine then !

146
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:21,086
Give up and die if you want, but
you're not dragging me down...!

147
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:26,152
I'm seriously
leaving you here...!

148
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:30,252
I'm not messin' around, Ling!

149
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:40,386
[Ling] I thought you
were gonna leave me behind.

150
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,052
[Ed] There's way
too many people

151
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:44,219
I'd be letting
down by dying here...

152
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,852
And you've
got people waiting

153
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:48,452
for you to get back too, right?

154
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:51,452
Now shut up... If
you're strong enough--

155
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:53,119
[Ed cries out]

156
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,919
[Loud splash]

157
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:01,708
[Ed and Ling gasping]

158
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:06,241
[Ling] So hungry... I wish
we could find something to eat.

159
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:11,675
[Ed] Well, actually...
Y'know...

160
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:21,008
Leather goods are edible...
We've got a meal.

161
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,708
And that should do it.

162
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:25,608
Here ya go.

163
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:29,808
You don't have
athlete's foot, do you?

164
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:33,375
My foot is made
of metal, you idiot!

165
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:37,275
[Ed] Ohhh, man...
that shoe filled me up.

166
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,041
[Ling] I'm sorry, Ed.

167
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,641
[Ed] And why's that?

168
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:42,941
[Ling] It's all my fault
that you're here.

169
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:46,341
It is not... Besides,
this place is a joke

170
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,775
compared to what my
teacher's put me through...

171
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:51,841
It just sucks that we have
no idea where this place is...

172
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,641
But that's alright... As
long as we've got our health,

173
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,375
we can find an
exit out of here.

174
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,741
You're sure optimistic.

175
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:01,775
Not really, I'm just stubborn...

176
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,308
And if I even think
about giving up,

177
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:06,208
I have Al's iron fists
to look forward to.

178
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,975
[Ling hmms]

179
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,341
What's wrong?

180
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:12,975
There's something out there.

181
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:15,675
[Ling] Is that...?

182
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:18,708
I thought so-- I should've
known it would be you guys.

183
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,808
It's definitely Envy.

184
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:23,041
Please show me
the way outta here!

185
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,708
You're just gonna start begging
the enemy for help like that?!

186
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,808
If it means surviving,
I'll be his best friend...!

187
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:33,141
[Envy] It doesn't matter
because there is no exit.

188
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:35,975
You've really gotten
us into a fine mess...

189
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:38,975
I can't believe you got
me swallowed with you.

190
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,275
You just said swallowed...

191
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:44,208
So we really are inside
Gluttony's stomach?

192
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,241
Well, yes and no. See, It's a
lot more complicated than that.

193
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,941
[Envy] Just ask the pips--

194
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,908
I mean ask the alchemist...

195
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:54,175
he should've realized
what this place is.

196
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:57,241
I did notice something when
Gluttony swallowed us...

197
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,941
It was like I had
a familiar feeling.

198
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:02,675
[Envy] So you do
remember then...?

199
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:05,708
This isn't the first time
you've been through this.

200
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,341
The portal of Truth!

201
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,608
[Ed] But...

202
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:20,075
But it wasn't pitch black and
filled with a sea of blood...

203
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:23,808
It was more like...
like an entirely white void.

204
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,708
[Envy] Oh, yeah...?

205
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,175
So that's what the
real one looks like.

206
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:28,275
[Ed] The real one?

207
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:30,941
[Envy] Gluttony is a failed
experiment by our Father

208
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,208
to create his
own Portal of Truth.

209
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,708
He's... a what?

210
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,675
Despite how powerful our Father

211
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:40,341
is, he still couldn't
create one...

212
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:44,175
We're trapped inside a
defective Portal of Truth.

213
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:45,675
[Envy] So this place...?

214
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:48,708
It exists somewhere in
between reality and truth.

215
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,341
In between?

216
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:53,608
And I can assure you that
there is no way out of here...

217
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:55,075
The only option we've got

218
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:58,108
is to sit here until
our strength runs out...

219
00:11:58,108 --> 00:11:59,675
And that's it.

220
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:03,608
[Envy] All we can do
is wait here to die.

221
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,608
<i>[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

222
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:10,775
<i>[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

223
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,075
No way.

224
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:17,208
Don't think I'm falling
for any of that crap...!

225
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,108
I know you're
lying to us, Envy!

226
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:21,275
[Ed] You're lying...!
Aren't you?!

227
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:27,075
So There really isn't a way
out... We're gonna die here?

228
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:33,875
Wait... No... Hold on...
I can't die here!

229
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,241
What's Al gonna do if I die?!

230
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,641
We made a promise and he...

231
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:42,675
He needs me to
get back to normal!

232
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:46,075
Damn it. I wanna know
who your Father is...

233
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:48,675
Who would try to create
their own portal...?!

234
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:52,041
It's Fuhrer Bradley, isn't it?!

235
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,741
What, are you serious...? Ha...!

236
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:58,575
Nice try, but King Bradley is
nothing more than a Homunculus.

237
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:00,975
Told ya so.

238
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:04,075
[Ed] The Fifth Laboratory...

239
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:08,708
Human lives sacrificed to
make Philosopher's Stones...

240
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,875
Homunculi...

241
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,875
And If the Fuhrer
is on your side,

242
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,108
then I'm guessing you
were the ones behind Ishval.

243
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:18,075
Oh, Ishval?

244
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:19,308
[Envy laughs]

245
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:22,875
I couldn't have asked for a
more enjoyable job than that...!

246
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,075
You remember the incident
that started the war, right?

247
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:29,875
I had always heard it was
because a military officer

248
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,108
accidentally shot
an Ishvalan child.

249
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:35,341
Yep! And the one that
proudly pulled the trigger

250
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:37,841
was none other
than yours truly...

251
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,808
[May Chang] 'Scuse me?

252
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:08,675
I know what happened
in Ishval... Yoki told me.

253
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:15,175
[Envy] You have no idea
how good that felt...

254
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:18,708
I ravaged their entire
country with a single bullet!

255
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:22,708
I mean, talk about invigorating!

256
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,741
[Envy] Oh, and the best part?

257
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:26,975
The officer that
I pretended to be?

258
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:29,341
He was actually a
moderate who had always

259
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:33,708
publicly opposed the
military's occupation in Ishval.

260
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,908
[Envy] And listen to this!

261
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:38,308
The poor fool couldn't come
up with a plausible defense

262
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:40,175
and they court-martialed him!

263
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:42,175
You know I don't
think I'll ever get over

264
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,008
how easily
manipulated humans are.

265
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:46,308
[Envy cackles]

266
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,908
So you're responsible...

267
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:52,775
You were the one who shot and
killed that poor innocent child.

268
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:55,875
[Ed] You destroyed
my hometown...

269
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,208
You drove out the Ishvalans.

270
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,875
You're the one who turned
Scar into a murderer.

271
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,775
And it was you...

272
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:07,075
You're the reason
Winry's parents were killed.

273
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:09,975
You're the one to blame!

274
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:14,941
What the hell?

275
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:17,041
[Ed] He didn't budge!

276
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,141
Okay, then...
If that's how you want it.

277
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:22,808
[Ling] Ed! Get back!

278
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:26,208
[Chanting sounds in background]

279
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:30,275
I'm gonna show you two boys
somethin' neat before we die...

280
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:33,675
Consider it a parting gift.

281
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:35,075
Did you notice his footprints?

282
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:36,875
Back when we were all
fighting in the forest?

283
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,108
What...? No.

284
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,508
What's your point?

285
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,208
Just that he's freakishly heavy
for the size of his body...

286
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,241
He might be a bit
bigger than he looks.

287
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:55,675
[Roaring]

288
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:03,708
[Ed] Damn!

289
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,041
[Ling grunts] What the hell?!

290
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,608
[Ed] How is that
a Homunculus...?

291
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:11,308
They're supposed to be
artificial humans, right?!

292
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:40,692
[Gluttony whispers]
What should... What do I do?

293
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,292
[Al] I have no idea.

294
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,258
What do I do...? I'm scared.

295
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,225
[Gluttony] I don't want
Father to be mad at me!

296
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:57,658
[Al] What did you say...?
You have a father?

297
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:59,025
Uhuh!

298
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:02,025
[Al] Is he the one
who made the Homunculi?

299
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:03,892
Father made us.

300
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:11,092
<i>[Al] Where does everything
he swallows go...?</i>

301
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:15,692
<i>It's gotta be some kind of
trick... C'mon... Think...!</i>

302
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:18,958
<i>We made a promise and
Brother might still be alive...</i>

303
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,758
<i>I can't just give up now!</i>

304
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:25,725
[Al] Gluttony! Will
you take me with you...?

305
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:28,058
Will you take me
to meet your father?

306
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,392
I guess so.

307
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:35,858
He'll be happy since
you're a human sacrifice!

308
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:40,825
[Al] Oh, sure, right...
That's why he'll wanna meet me.

309
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:45,625
<i>[Al] And I guess I'll
find out... What that means.</i>

310
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,025
[Official 1]
In regards to the search

311
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,225
for potential sacrifices...

312
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:52,092
Our only candidates
are the Elric brothers.

313
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:55,658
[Official 2] What about Doctor
Marcoh...? Isn't he ready?

314
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,692
[Official 3]
We still have Kimblee.

315
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:59,392
I doubt that Kimblee
could muster up the nerve

316
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:01,225
it takes to open the portal...

317
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:04,292
That reminds me...
How have things been

318
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,325
progressing along with
Mustang's candidacy?

319
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:10,358
That's a question
for the Fuhrer...

320
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:13,292
[Raven] He plans on having
a nice long talk with him.

321
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:19,225
[Roy] Tell me... Why are you
bothering to let me live?

322
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:20,825
Because you
aren't going to learn

323
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:23,825
your lesson if
you're dead, soldier.

324
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:27,992
And the military...? How long
has all this been going on?

325
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:29,825
The Homunculi
have been controlling

326
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:33,225
this entire nation
since its inception.

327
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,725
So all this time
you've been sitting back

328
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,325
and laughing at our struggles?

329
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,758
I saw you at General
Hughes' funeral.

330
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,958
Your hands were trembling.

331
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,158
So did you fake that as well?

332
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,892
[Bradley] Why must
everyone make such a fuss

333
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:51,158
over the death of
a single soldier...?

334
00:18:51,158 --> 00:18:53,658
The moment a soldier
dons his uniform,

335
00:18:53,658 --> 00:18:58,358
he accepts the reality
that he might be buried in it.

336
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:00,958
And about my hands...

337
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,825
Hughes' child screeched

338
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:07,125
throughout the
entirety of his funeral.

339
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,358
My hands were
trembling with anger.

340
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,958
[Roy] How can you
even say such a thing...?

341
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,958
You have a child, too.

342
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,058
[Bradley] You're
speaking of Selim...?

343
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:20,758
He's more
well-behaved than that.

344
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:22,692
And how do you think he'd react

345
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:27,025
if he found out that his
father is a Homunculus?

346
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,825
Was that a threat?

347
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,358
You'll have to do better.

348
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:33,092
[Bradley] Selim will never work

349
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:36,092
as a point of
weakness in my life.

350
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:39,025
But you, on the other hand...

351
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:42,725
I know exactly who to
use as your weak point.

352
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:48,092
[Fuery] Lieutenant Hawkeye!

353
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:49,825
What's wrong, Sergeant?

354
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:52,758
I received a memo from
the Personnel Bureau.

355
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:53,858
And well...

356
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:57,758
I'm being transferred to
the Southern Command Center.

357
00:19:57,758 --> 00:19:59,192
They transferred you?!

358
00:19:59,192 --> 00:20:01,358
And I'm not the only one.

359
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:04,725
[Fuery] Breda's being sent
to the Western Command.

360
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:05,658
And Warrant Officer Falman's

361
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:08,092
been reassigned to
the Northern Command.

362
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:17,925
[Footsteps]

363
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:20,825
Lieutenant Hawkeye?

364
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:21,825
[Hawkeye] Yes, sir.

365
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:24,292
I'm Yakovlev, from Personnel.

366
00:20:24,292 --> 00:20:25,958
<i>[Haweye]
Am I being transferred?</i>

367
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,692
And my name is Storch.

368
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:30,292
I'm the personal assistant
to the Fuhrer Bradley...

369
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:32,025
I need you to take this.

370
00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:34,825
Am I being reassigned, sir?

371
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:36,592
That's correct.

372
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:40,725
[Haweye] I'd like
to look at them.

373
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,192
What is this?

374
00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:48,925
This can't be right! Are you
sure that these are my orders?

375
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:51,158
[Fuery] Where are
they sending you?

376
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:54,392
First Lieutenant Riza
Hawkeye is to report for duty...

377
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:57,158
At Central Command Center...

378
00:20:57,158 --> 00:21:00,692
As personal assistant
to Fuhrer Bradley.

379
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:03,725
[Bradley] It's
as simple as that.

380
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:06,692
She'll be under my
watch from now on.

381
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:11,958
[Voices] Please, make it stop!

382
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,858
It hurts so much!

383
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,692
Play with me, let's play!

384
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:19,058
[Ed] Hell no... You go
on and play by yourself.

385
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:21,092
[Ling] Ugh... This isn't good.

386
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:22,992
[Envy laughs]

387
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,692
[Crash
Ling screams]

388
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:28,025
Ling!

389
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,358
[Smack
Ed grunts]

390
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:32,825
[Envy laughs maniacally]

391
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,592
[Ling] Ed!

392
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:39,225
Can you make a weapon?

393
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:42,192
[Ed] You got it! With
this ocean of blood...

394
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:44,725
There's plenty of
iron to work with.

395
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,225
You have the
tackiest sense of taste.

396
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:56,025
Ah, c'mon... I think it looks
pretty damn sharp, myself.

397
00:21:57,758 --> 00:21:59,692
[Envy laughs]

398
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:00,992
[Ed] Can we take him?

399
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:04,692
[Ling] I doubt it...
He is a giant monster.

400
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,225
And then on top of that,

401
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,992
I'm pretty sure he
broke two of my ribs.

402
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:10,758
Yeah, I'm pretty beat up myself.

403
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:12,658
But that's beside the point...

404
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:15,958
All that matters now is
filling him with some pain!

405
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:24,692
[Al] Are you sure this is
the right way, Gluttony?

406
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:25,925
Uh-huh.

407
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:30,858
[Al] But this is the
way... It can't be.

408
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,792
Your father is
living in Central?

409
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,125
