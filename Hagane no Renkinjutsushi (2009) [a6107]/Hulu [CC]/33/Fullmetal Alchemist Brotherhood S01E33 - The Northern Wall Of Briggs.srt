1
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:36,311
<i>[NARRATOR] Ed and Al are
frantically searching for May,</i>

2
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:39,745
<i>a young girl from Xing
who practices alkahestry.</i>

3
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:42,511
<i>After receiving a tip
from Colonel Mustang,</i>

4
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:45,311
<i>the brothers head
north in pursuit.</i>

5
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:47,345
<i>Meanwhile,
Scar leaves Central</i>

6
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:49,711
<i>and blazes a
trail heading west...</i>

7
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:51,345
<i>His every movement is tracked</i>

8
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:54,411
<i>by the Crimson
Alchemist Kimblee.</i>

9
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:57,378
<i>However, under the
deep cover of night...</i>

10
00:01:57,378 --> 00:02:00,811
<i>Scar's trail
inexplicably disappears.</i>

11
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:06,678
[KIMBLEE] If he was going
to jump from the train

12
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:08,645
this is where he would do it.

13
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:12,278
The engine's speed
would decrease here.

14
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:13,745
So what we need to know...

15
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:17,511
is which way he headed
after reaching this point.

16
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,678
Any Scar sightings to report?

17
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:21,845
[OFFICER A]
No... Nothing definite.

18
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:24,211
[KIMBLEE]
That's odd... Up until now,

19
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,211
he's been deliberately conspicuous.

20
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:28,778
I have a report, sir...!

21
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:30,545
There was a small
boat that was stolen

22
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:33,278
near the river about two
hundred meters south of here.

23
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,411
Was it Scar?

24
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:37,211
There aren't any eyewitnesses
to confirm that, sir.

25
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:38,111
[OFFICER A]
Look into it!

26
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:39,245
Yes, Sir!

27
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:40,178
Reporting, sir...!

28
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:42,245
We've talked to an
old man who lives nearby

29
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,278
that claims to have seen

30
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:45,678
a suspicious pair of
men who were heading west.

31
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:47,678
[OFFICER B]
Hmm... Could be our targets...

32
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:49,778
Take a search
party to investigate.

33
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:51,178
[SOLDIER B]
Sir!

34
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:54,211
Is there something wrong?

35
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:57,511
[KIMBLEE] I'm not sure
yet... On the map...

36
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,545
looks like there's a road
near here that leads north...

37
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:02,245
There--what is that?

38
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,145
[OFFICER A] It was an old
logging road that passed

39
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:05,645
through the mountains
to the North Area,

40
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,145
but there were
too many rockslides,

41
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,545
so they had to
close it down...

42
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:11,311
Why do you ask?

43
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:30,611
[OFFICER B] There are
several other places

44
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,445
further on where rockslides
have closed the road.

45
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:46,645
[KIMBLEE] The water's
flow here has been altered.

46
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,478
[OFFICER B] Yes, sir...
Does that mean something?

47
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,711
[KIMBLEE] For an alchemist
skilled in destruction...

48
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:57,545
clearing even
this big an obstacle

49
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:59,378
would be a simple task.

50
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:00,745
[OFFICER A]
Sir?

51
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:02,311
And it would be equally simple

52
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:03,811
for him to destroy
the face of a mountain

53
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:07,445
to once again block this
road with a rockslide.

54
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:12,545
[OFFICER A]
Transmutation marks?

55
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,578
Send the soldiers north.

56
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:30,859
Look! There's snow!

57
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:46,792
[AL]
Brother!

58
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:52,759
[AL]
Ed, you are so uncoordinated.

59
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,825
Oh, shut up...! It was
just a little slip! Jeez...

60
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:00,625
[AL]
All this snow is amazing, huh?

61
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,359
Yeah... you don't get much snow

62
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:05,392
like this back home,
that's for sure.

63
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,359
Oh yeah, Hey Al...!

64
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,292
Do you remember that
one really heavy snow

65
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,625
we had back when
we were little?

66
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,392
[AL]
Maybe...

67
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,559
[AL]
Oh yeah, I remember!

68
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,725
We had a snowball fight!

69
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:21,559
[ED]
And we made a snowman!

70
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,325
[AL]
Yea!

71
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,625
Back then I never imagined

72
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,725
we would come this far north...

73
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:31,759
It seemed impossible.

74
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,492
Yeah... but here we are now.

75
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:45,892
So, now what do we do...?

76
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:47,359
We still have a
little bit of time

77
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,892
before our train
to Briggs takes off.

78
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,525
[AL] Why don't you
grab something to eat?

79
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:53,025
[ED]
Eh, I don't know...

80
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,759
I'm really not
all that hungry...

81
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,625
But... I guess
we could look.

82
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,792
[AL] Careful! You're
gonna fall again!

83
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,559
[ED]
Shut up!

84
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:06,059
[SOLDIER D]
As of three hours ago,

85
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,592
the express still
hadn't arrived.

86
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:08,759
That accident last night
is really holding things up.

87
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,392
Any new information?

88
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:11,692
[OFFICER A]
Unfortunately, no.

89
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:15,025
But we're doing
everything we can.

90
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,759
There was a man
fitting Scar's description

91
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,459
seen at the station
one stop ahead, sir.

92
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:20,892
Are you sure
about that, soldier?

93
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:22,359
Absolutely, sir...

94
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:24,525
Eyewitnesses saw
him getting aboard

95
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:26,959
a military train bound
for the Briggs station.

96
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,592
Was anyone with him?

97
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:30,459
[SOLDIER C] A middle-aged
man with black hair,

98
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,892
just like the report says.

99
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,525
I'll have the train
stopped at once!

100
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:37,892
[KIMBLEE]
That won't be necessary...

101
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:39,892
We don't want him
jumping off the train again,

102
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:41,725
after all.

103
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,792
All right. From now on

104
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:50,592
this job is mine and mine alone.

105
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:52,792
I don't want you
people getting in my way,

106
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,392
understand me?

107
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:57,692
[train whistle blow]

108
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:05,325
Sleep while you can...

109
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,559
As soon as we hit
the northern cold,

110
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,759
you won't be able to sleep,

111
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,592
even if you want to.

112
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:02,592
I'm jumping over
to that train now,

113
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:03,792
so match it's speed.

114
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,392
Roger, sir.

115
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:33,828
[KIMBLEE]
Doctor Marcoh...

116
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,380
I'm here to apprehend you...

117
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,846
You can't run anymore.

118
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:39,513
Surely you're not alone...

119
00:08:39,513 --> 00:08:42,646
Where's your friend Scar?

120
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:44,413
It's time to give up.

121
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,946
Sorry, but you're
not going anywhere...

122
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,780
You're mine, now.

123
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:54,580
Who're you?

124
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:04,580
The murderous Ishvalan

125
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,680
I've heard so much about.

126
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,646
So good to see you.

127
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:30,580
[roars]

128
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,880
[explosion]

129
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:37,646
I don't want to be anywhere

130
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,613
near these monsters
when they're fighting...

131
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,846
I think it's about time
for me to get off this train.

132
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,446
I can't!

133
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:01,546
[SCAR] So you're Solf
J. Kimblee, are you...?

134
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:03,946
Known as the Crimson Alchemist.

135
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:06,613
Tell me, do you
remember my face?

136
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:09,580
Oh... I remember
you very well indeed...

137
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,680
You were in the
Kanda district of Ishval,

138
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,380
isn't that right?

139
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,613
And those people with you...

140
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:18,580
they were members
of your family, yes?

141
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,913
I remember another fellow

142
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:20,946
who looked just like you,

143
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:22,813
except he had glasses...

144
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:23,880
Of course, it's hard to see

145
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,313
a family resemblance
when someone

146
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:28,680
is losing tons of blood
and screaming in agony.

147
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,980
<i>[KIMBLEE]
This could be bad...</i>

148
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,980
<i>I just got out of prison,
and I'm still rusty...</i>

149
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,346
<i>but he's been fighting
continuously since the war.</i>

150
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:52,580
<i>Physically, I'm
at a disadvantage.</i>

151
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,446
<i>And all this man knows
how to do is destroy...</i>

152
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,846
Good to know you
remember my brother.

153
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:11,213
I'll deal with you just
as you dealt with him.

154
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,646
It's quite a shame...
that twice now...

155
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:16,913
I've failed to kill
the same Ishvalan mongrel

156
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:19,246
when I've had
him in my sights.

157
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:28,580
[explosion]

158
00:11:33,513 --> 00:11:35,546
It's terribly humiliating
to have to leave

159
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:38,380
when we were just getting
things started here...

160
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,546
But don't worry...

161
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:42,813
We'll settle this
next time, Ishvalan!

162
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,780
[SCAR screams]
Kimblee!!

163
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:59,413
Dammit, I can't see...

164
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:01,580
What do you think
that sound was?

165
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,213
We lost the rear cars!

166
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,246
Well what do we do...?

167
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:17,813
The military told us
not to stop for anything!

168
00:12:17,813 --> 00:12:18,946
We have to...!

169
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,546
If we let this train derail,

170
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:23,380
we're gonna be the ones
who are blamed for it.

171
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,813
[ENGINEER A] Sir! Sir...
What happened...?! Sir?!

172
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,513
What're you doing...?

173
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,646
Who said you were
allowed to stop?

174
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,213
Huh?

175
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:49,780
[KIMBLEE]
Keep the train going...

176
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,846
We're heading north!

177
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,946
Ah, yes... death...
it's closing in.

178
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,913
One who spreads
death and destruction...

179
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,946
must accept their pursuit...

180
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:07,380
He will never be
far from either...

181
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,846
But what could
be more beautiful

182
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:12,313
than doing work that
puts your soul at risk...?

183
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:16,246
Because that's what
it means to be alive...

184
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:19,413
At least on this battlefield!

185
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:29,613
[MAY] I hope Mr. Scar and
Mr. Yoki are doing all right.

186
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:31,980
[MARCOH] Since no one
has come after us so far...

187
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,513
they must be
doing a good job

188
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,946
of drawing the
military's attention...

189
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:38,813
I hope they're safe, too.

190
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:40,680
Hey, what's wrong?

191
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,813
Nothing.

192
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:43,313
My skin's still healing.

193
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,413
It stings to have the
wind blowing against it,

194
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:46,813
that's all.

195
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:47,780
[MAY]
I'm sorry...

196
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,213
I wish I could've healed
your face completely

197
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:51,946
so it wouldn't hurt so much.

198
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:53,046
[MARCOH]
No...

199
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:56,380
This is the face a man
like me deserves to wear...

200
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,680
I am content with it.

201
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,513
Stop for a second.
Look over there!

202
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,613
[MARCOH]
The Briggs Mountain Range.

203
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:08,280
Those peaks mark our
border with Drachma,

204
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,646
the large country to the north.

205
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:11,680
Judging by those,

206
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,980
we should be getting close

207
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,946
to the place Scar showed us.

208
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:16,713
Let's see...

209
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:21,346
[MAY]
It's right over there!

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,601
[WINRY] What...? They're
not there at the hotel?

213
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,354
[FRONT DESK]
No... they left yesterday.

214
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:52,921
Do you have any idea
where they might have gone?

215
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:55,921
[FRONT DESK] I believe they
said they were going north.

216
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:59,288
Oh, all right...
Well, thank you.

217

[GARFIEL]
What's the matter...?

219
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,454
Is something wrong
with the brothers?

220
00:15:06,454 --> 00:15:09,321
I'm not sure. Apparently,
they're heading north.

221
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:13,354

Oh, dear... You know
what that means...

222
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:15,354
They're gonna die.

Ooh, I'm cold all right...
That's Briggs for you.

All right, this is
where I let you go, boys.

227
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,548
If you follow
this mountain road...

228
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,381
it'll lead you
straight to Fort Briggs.

No.

233
00:15:43,414 --> 00:15:46,414
Oh, okay... Well then
you should be all right.

What was that all about?

00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,048
[AL]
Beats me.

236
00:15:53,114 --> 00:15:55,181
That's military land
beyond the fence,

00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:57,548

the weather here
changes quickly,

243
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:22,548

extreme if you ask me.

[AL] What do we
do now, brother...?

245
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:26,548

Sure she could.

254
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:40,614
She even killed a bear.

more than fifteen feet tall...

256

have killed one of them!

Bear!

258

Hey, wait! Hold on a second...

00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:15,581
Is that a military
uniform you're wearing?

262
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,614
Well it looks like some
pretty mediocre stuff...

263

but you have
automail too, huh?

264
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:20,948
Huh...? Mediocre?

00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:22,948

gonna kill me!

That wasn't
too bad, kid...

ordinary automail you have...

Major Armstrong from

Sure.

00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,248
But how do I verify that?

[PATROLMAN B]
What's this?

330
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:29,381
General!

That's a letter of introduction

[ED] Aren't you even
going to read it?!

337
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:47,548
[OLIVIER]
A letter of introduction

338
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,281
means nothing to me.

in anyone else's
opinions of a person...

Th-Th-That's amazing!

That wall is really,

347
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:27,048
Quit gaping like an
idiot and start walking...

body apart limb from limb.

349

Be warned: I won't coddle
you because you're children.

00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,514
This is the mountain
fortress... Briggs.

Here, only the strong survive.

00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:26,448
[MAY]
There it is!

353
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:37,448
[MARCOH] That's it. Scar's
brother's research notebook.

354
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:39,281
[MAY] He studied different
ways of combining

355
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:41,648
Xingese Alkahestry
with Amestrian Alchemy,

356
00:23:41,648 --> 00:23:42,781
didn't he...?

357
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:45,448
Do you think that could be
the secret to immortality?

358
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:48,914
[MARCOH]
I'm not sure, but maybe so.

359
00:23:48,914 --> 00:23:50,248
Will the information

360
00:23:50,248 --> 00:23:52,081
in this book bring us hope...?

361
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:55,414
Or do its pages contain
nothing but despair?

362
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:02,181
Well... there's only
one way to find out.

363
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:06,648
<i>[NARRATOR]

367
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:19,614
<i>She is feared...
and she is fearless.</i>

368
00:24:19,614 --> 00:24:23,548
<i>Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood...</i>

369
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:28,548
<i>Episode 34: "Ice Queen."</i>

370
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:32,148
<i>Behold... This is
the way of Briggs.</i>
