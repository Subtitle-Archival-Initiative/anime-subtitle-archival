00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:07,555
[NARRATOR]
A man must come to know his
enemy as clearly as he knows

351
00:24:07,555 --> 00:24:11,222
his own self in order to
see his victory in battle.

352
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:13,888
And while their two
lives may end as one,

353
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:16,588
he will not die for nothing.

354
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,955
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood,

355
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:23,722
Episode 57: Eternal Leave.

356
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,622
Farewell, my powerful master.

357
00:24:28,622 --> 00:24:32,255
I promise to eternally watch
over you from the other side.
