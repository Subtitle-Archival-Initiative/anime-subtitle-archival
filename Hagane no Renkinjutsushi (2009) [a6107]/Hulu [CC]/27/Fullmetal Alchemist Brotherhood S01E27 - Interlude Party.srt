will make us strong.

352
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:07,172
And if that's not enough...

353
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:08,406
If you're still not convinced

354
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:11,039
that we can change...

355
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,272
Then think about us.

356
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:16,106
All of the days we spent...

357
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:18,406
With our family in Resembool.

358
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:07,206
I was dreaming...

359
00:22:26,272 --> 00:22:28,539
Thanks for all the help.

360
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:05,906
[NARRATOR]
If you find
yourself overwhelmed

361
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:08,606
with a debilitating fear
by the unfathomable power

362
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,239
looming before you,

363
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,472
then you should
run like a coward.

364
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:13,906
And if you lose
what you believe

365
00:24:13,906 --> 00:24:15,972
to be your only power,

366
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:17,439
then you might
as well succumb

367
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,239
to your own weakness.

368
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,872
This is the battle
that you feared was coming.

369
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:24,506
Put everything you've
got into it, human.

370
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:27,906
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.

371
00:24:27,906 --> 00:24:30,472
Episode Twenty Eight... Father.
