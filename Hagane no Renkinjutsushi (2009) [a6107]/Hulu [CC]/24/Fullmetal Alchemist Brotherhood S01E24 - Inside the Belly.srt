1
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,294
[door opening and closing]

2
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:42,088
[Envy] Oh, no, not again...
We've told you,

3
00:01:42,088 --> 00:01:45,654
you're an important
candidate for sacrifice.

4
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:49,154
We need you to keep your
strength up.. Understand?

5
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:51,621
So.. dig in, Dr. Marcoh.

6
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:55,488
You know what?... I've been
sitting here awhile...

7
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:58,954
trying to decide what
you mean by 'sacrifice'...

8
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,154
trying to figure
out why I'm here...

9
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:06,954
and what it is exactly
you want me to do.

10
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:09,288
[Marcoh] I'm fairly certain that
what you're doing right now

11
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:11,088
is using this land
and its people

12
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:14,088
to form a giant
transmutation circle.

13
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:17,021
And your hope is that the end
result will be the creation of

14
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:19,688
a Philosopher's Stone.
Am I wrong?

15
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:24,454
So close... Not quite... But
you're on the right track.

16
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:25,721
Then what is it?

17
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:29,288
The question is.. are you going
to cooperate with us or not?...

18
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:31,588
If not, the village is history.

19
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:32,954
[gasp]

20
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:35,921
Lust told me about
your arrangement...

21
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:39,121
If we agree to leave
the village alone...

22
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:42,354
then you'll do whatever we ask.

23
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:43,554
Which is it?...

24
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:47,088
Agree to work with us, and kill
everyone in this country...

25
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:48,488
Or refuse to work with us...

26
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:51,654
and watch everyone in your
beloved village die.

27
00:02:53,654 --> 00:02:57,121
[Envy] Fool. You just have to
forsake one little village

28
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:59,521
to save an entire country...

29
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:01,188
Too bad you don't
have the stomach

30
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:03,421
to do the logical thing.

31
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:07,188
I shouldn't be surprised. That's
just how all you humans are.

32
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,988
[Envy] You put emotions
before common sense.

33
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:11,954
I killed a man who
was like that once.

34
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:14,621
All I had to do was make
myself look like his wife,

35
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,654
and he was helpless. He
couldn't even fight me.

36
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:22,621
Humans are so easy to take
advantage of... Lucky us.

37
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:33,421
[crickets chirping]

38
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,688
[Pride] The humans seem to
be giving you quite a bit

39
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:40,388
of trouble lately, don't
they... Wrath. Hm?

40
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,454
First Scar gets away from you,

41
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:47,288
then those others make off with
Gluttony. It's not like you.

42
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:51,421
Yes... you are
right about that.

43
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:53,088
[Pride] And yet, you seem happy.

44
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:59,021
Yes, I won't deny it.
This has been... enjoyable.

45
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,154
[Bradley] I've been
alive for sixty years...

46
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:05,388
And now, here I am, in the
ultimate position of power.

47
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:08,654
All has gone exactly as
Father had planned it would.

48
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:11,521
[Pride] There's more though...

49
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:13,554
Roy Mustang and
his underlings...

50
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:15,988
The enterprising
Elric brothers...

51
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:19,988
And these foreigners who
suddenly appeared from Xing...

52
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:21,354
As good as we are,

53
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:25,021
they've still got us
scrambling in circles.

54
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:26,588
Things are changing.

55
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:29,121
The time may be approaching
when we have to move over

56
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:32,921
for the younger generation...
Don't you see?

57
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,021
[Pride] Listen to
yourself, Wrath...

58
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,088
You've been around these
humans for far too long.

59
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:39,621
[Bradley] You may
be right, Pride.

60
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:41,988
[Pride] I hope you will
stop this foolishness

61
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:45,354
and remember who we are
and what we must do.

62
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:48,621
I won't tell Father what
you've said tonight...

63
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,488
He might be inclined
to see it as treason.

64
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:53,421
Anyway, about Gluttony...

65
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:56,288
Don't worry about that...

66
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:59,121
I have access to military
information, after all.

67
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:00,654
I know where he is.

68
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:07,088
[Hawkeye] What was that?!

69
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:09,021
Colonel! What's going on?

70
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,321
[Roy] Hawkeye, stop!

71
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,121
[transmutation sounds]

72
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:20,254
[rattling, wood breaking]

73
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,888
[roaring]

74
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:28,454
[Hawkeye] Colonel!

75
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,154
[muffled] Lieutenant...

76
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:34,154
Don't provoke him!
I'm the one he wants!

77
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:37,654
[roaring] Mustang!

78
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,554
[Ling] Come on... We're
getting out of here.

79
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:42,421
What is it?...
What's happening?

80
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:43,654
The Homunculus...

81
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:46,421
He had another monster
hidden inside his belly.

82
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:50,554
[Ling] He's swallowing
up everything in sight!

83
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:53,554
<i>[Ed] Alchemy can produce
something like that?</i>

84
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,421
<i>How disgusting.</i>

85
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,621
Let's go.. We have
to bring him down.

86
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:00,621
[Al] But we worked so hard to
catch one of the Homunculi.

87
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,021
[Roy] Survival is our
first priority...

88
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:06,088
Besides... he knows our
names and faces now...

89
00:06:06,088 --> 00:06:08,688
It would be foolish to let
him leave here alive!

90
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,421
[explosion]

91
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:14,621
[Gluttony screaming]

92
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:20,454
[fire whooshing]

93
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:23,954
[burp]

94
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:25,154
He swallowed it?

95
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:26,521
[Al] Uh-oh.

96
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:28,554
[Gluttony roaring]

97
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,154
Hey, that worked well!

98
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:32,688
Think you can do better?
Be my guest!

99
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:35,254
[Al] Or we could just leave
you behind, Colonel...

100
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:38,021
You're the one he really wants.

101
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:40,454
Those trees over there.
Spread out!

102
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,488
[gunshots]

103
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:50,588
[Gluttony screaming,
transmutation sounds]

104
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:57,121
[wincing in pain]

105
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:59,421
<i>[Roy] Damn it... Not now.</i>

106
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,188
Hurry up and get in the car.

107
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,388
Come on, we haven't got all
night. We need to get moving!

108
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:13,321
But Ed and the others...

109
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:16,688
No way! I'm a civilian,
not military...

110
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:18,654
I'm not about to die in
the middle of a battle

111
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:20,488
with some crazed monster.

112
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:29,521
[Knox] Damn it! What's taking
those idiots so long?!

113
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:35,488
[Gluttony grunting]

114
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,188
Mustang!

115
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:39,954
[Gluttony screaming]

116
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:47,954
[Gluttony] Noooo!

117
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:50,221
Perfect. He fell for
the Mustang decoy.

118
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:52,921
[Al] Doesn't sound like
he's very happy about it.

119
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:57,454
All right... Now get in
the car... invalid.

120
00:07:57,454 --> 00:08:01,154
[Al] Lieutenant.. please
take care of Lan Fan.

121
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:04,054
You expect me to run away and
leave this to you, Elric?!

122
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:06,021
If you stay you'll
just get in our way!

123
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,054
[Al] Yeah! Leave!

124
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,521
They're right. You won't
be any use here... Sorry.

125
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:13,521
<i>[Ed] How did ths
idiot make Colonel?!</i>

126
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:16,321
[Ed] Right now you need to
go and do your job...

127
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,421
The head of the military
is a Homunculus.

128
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:21,421
Don't you think you should
do something about that?

129
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:23,321
The head of the military?...

130
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:25,921
You aren't talking about
Fuhrer Bradley, are you?!

131
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:28,421
We can talk about it
later... Now..get in!

132
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:33,554
The car looks full...
You go ahead.

133
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,654
You dumbasses!

134
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:36,154
You can't really
believe we'll let

135
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:38,254
a couple children fight
this battle for us!

136
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:40,088
With the senior staff
involved in this,

137
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,654
you're gonna need all
the help you can get.

138
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,388
And that would include getting
whatever information we can

139
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:46,554
out of this Gluttony
guy, wouldn't you say?

140
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:49,188
[Al] We'll stay here and
find out what we can...

141
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:52,421
I don't think it matters
much that we're children.

142
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:54,154
This was our mission
to begin with,

143
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:56,388
and we're going to
see it through.

144
00:08:56,388 --> 00:09:00,154
[Ed] We appreciate your
help up 'till now, though.

145
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:01,554
[Hawkeye] Here Edward...

146
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:03,288
I want you to take this...

147
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:05,254
You do know how to
use it, don't you?

148
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:11,021
[Al] That's a weapon...
for killing people.

149
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:14,254
Yes. But it's also a weapon
for protecting your lives.

150
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:22,321
It's your hands... They
weren't meant to kill.

151
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:26,254
And no dying, okay?

152
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:31,254
I'll take it.

153
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:35,621
[alchemical explosions]

154
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:38,154
Look after Lan Fan.

155
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:40,488
Wait... My lord!

156
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:50,288
Let's go... I said go!

157
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:52,288
Damn! What're they thinking?!

158
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:54,388
[Knox] Those three are gonna
get themselves killed!

159
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:57,654

160
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:03,988
[alchemical explosions]

161
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:07,354
[Gluttony] Mustang...

162
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:10,288
Where are you, Mustang?!...

163
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:14,254
You killed Lust!...
You will pay!

164
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:15,954
I know we said we'd
stay and all...

165
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:18,121
but that's seriously freaky.

166
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:20,021
He seems to be a bit angry.

167
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:21,588
[Al] How are we
gonna catch him?

168
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,021
[rustling bushes]

169
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:25,454
[Al] What was that?

170
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:30,388
[Al] A dog?

171
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:33,588
Stop it... Now, Gluttony!

172
00:10:33,588 --> 00:10:35,588
[Ed] A..a talking dog?!

173
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:38,354
Hey.. long time no see.

174
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:46,321
[transmutation sounds]

00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:49,021
How are ya, Fullmetal pipsqueak?

176
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,154
<i>[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

177
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:57,537
<i>[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

178
00:10:57,537 --> 00:11:01,837
[Ed] Dammit, I told you before:
don't call me short...!

179
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,804
Hey, calm down...

180
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:07,404
I'm just here to get Gluttony
back, nothing more than that...

181
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:08,504
I don't want to fight
you, pipsqueak.

182
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:10,304
[Ed] That's five now!

183
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,537
[Envy] What are
you talking about?

184
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:15,304
That's five times.... You called
me 'pipsqueak' twice here...

185
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,537
and three times in
the laboratory!

186
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:19,770
And don't tell me you've
forgotten already!

187
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,737
Impressive. You've got a
sharp memory there.

188
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:24,537
[Ed] Hold it!

189
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,504
You're becoming bothersome.

190
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:29,670
[Gluttony] Mustang was
here... Must avenge Lust!...

191
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,537
Swallow.. swallow...
swallow him up!

192
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:36,270
You don't get the colonel...
Or the Elric brothers.

193
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,137
[Gluttony] Why not?!

194
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:40,370
I've sensed this
multiplicity before.

195
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,670
How many people're
inside you... Homunculus?

196
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,337
I know you...

197
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:49,737
You're the kid who crossed
swords with Wrath, aren't you?

198
00:11:49,737 --> 00:11:51,504
What do you mean, 'kid'?!...

199
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:54,370
I happen to be the twelfth
son of the emperor of Xing.

200
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:54,904
My name i-

201
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:56,370
[Envy] Eat him.

202
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,737
[sirens] No no no no noooo!

203
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:01,670
[Ling screaming]

204
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,237
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

205
00:12:03,237 --> 00:12:04,504
[Al] Looks like they
really aren't allowed

206
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,837
to do anything to
the two of us.

207
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:07,870
In which case...

208
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,737
[clap, transmutation sounds]

209
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:14,137
[Ed] Ling.. you get that one!

210
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:18,170
Very well... Let's
see how good you are.

211
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,804
You held off Wrath, but how
will you do against me?

212
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,170
[Bradley] Oh... did he, now?

213
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,637
[Bradley's wife] Yes. It was
the best paper in the class...

214
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:29,670
He chose to write an essay
all about you, actually.

215
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,704
[Selim] Mom.. can I read
it to you guys now?

216
00:12:31,704 --> 00:12:34,370
Not at the table. Mind
your manners, dear.

217
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,537
Oh, don't be silly...
Why not?...

218
00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:39,304
Go ahead and read, son.
I'd like to hear it.

219
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:42,237
Great! "Essay on my dad"...

220
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:45,604
He's the Fuhrer of the
nation of Amestris...

221
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,204
He works hard all the time,

222
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:49,737
and everything he does
is for our country.

223
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:52,570
[Selim] The people of Amestris
are always in his heart.

224
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,337
He dedicates his life
to making them happy.

225
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:57,904
He deals with all sorts
of problems each day

226
00:12:57,904 --> 00:13:01,304
so everyone in our country
can live a good life.

227
00:13:01,304 --> 00:13:04,537
But no matter how busy
he gets doing his job,

228
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:06,837
my dad never forgets
his family...

229
00:13:06,837 --> 00:13:09,370
He loves me and my
mother very much.

230
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,437
He always looks out for us.

231
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,237
My dad's a good man...

232
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:17,837
He always listens to me when I
talk to him. He's always kind...

233
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:20,304
and protects our family...

234
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:24,337
And that is why... I
love my dad. The end.

235
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,304
Thank you for that,
Selim... very much.

236
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,204
You really know how
to use that thing.

237
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:33,537
Aww, thank you for the
compliment... really!

238
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:36,537
You fell for it!

239
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:37,804
[Envy] Good, isn't it?...

240
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:41,670
And you humans can't do anything
like it... So, what'll it be?

241
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,837
Strangled to death?...
bitten to death?

242
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:47,870
Or just carved up
into little pieces?

243
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,670
None of the above.

244
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,904
[transmutation sounds]

245
00:13:54,904 --> 00:14:02,637
[Envy groaning in pain]

246
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,770
[Envy] That was
a dirty trick...

247
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,504
Blinding me. That's
not playing fair.

248
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:11,604
[Ling] People have been
trying to assassinate me

249
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:12,670
since I was a kid...

250
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,237
Under the circumstances,

251
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:16,904
you can't blame a guy for
learning how to fight dirty.

252
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:18,604
So, have you had enough yet?

253
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:20,870
Are you going to come
with me quietly now?...

254
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,437
I just want whatever
information you can give me

255
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:25,270
on becoming immortal.

256
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,437
[Ling] Or shall we go again?

257
00:14:26,437 --> 00:14:30,837
You scum!... A mere human like
you can't condescend to me!

258
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:34,470
You seem to underestimate
humans... And that's a mistake!

259
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,870
[transmutation sounds]

260
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,404
[Ed] Nice! Got 'im!

261
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:42,537
Whew!.. That was a close one.

262
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:44,170
[Ed] I've had enough of you!

263
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,204
[Gluttony] Get away.
I can't eat you!

264
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:49,370
Just let me take a bite
out of the other guy!

265
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,404
[Al] Not today!

266
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:54,837
[Al screaming, crashing]

267
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:57,204
Stay out of my way,
guys. I'm busy.

268
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:00,670
[Envy screaming]

269
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,504
<i>[Envy] Another foolish human.</i>

270
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,504
Go for it, Gluttony!

271
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:09,304
[Ed] Ling!

272
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:10,870
What?!

273
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,370
<i>[Envy] Dammit!.., I can't let
him eat a sacrifice!</i>

274
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,204
[Al] Brother!

275
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:17,537
[explosion,
transmutation sounds]

276
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,404
[trees breaking and falling]

277
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,570
[disintegrating noise]

278
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,137
[Gluttony] Swallowed them?

279
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:45,904
[Al] Brother!.. Ling!... You!...

280
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,504
Spit them out!...
Spit them out now!

281
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:50,504
I can't... I
swallowed them.

282
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:54,370
[transmutation sounds]

283
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,504
[Al] Impossible... it
can't be... Brother!

284
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:03,404
[Al screaming]

285
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:12,435
[Knox] I do have another room
that my kid used to sleep in.

286
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:15,735
But people will get suspicious
if I keep all the lights on...

287
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:17,702
You'll have to make
do with my bed.

288
00:16:17,702 --> 00:16:20,302
My lord. I have to go to him!

289
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:23,735
Idiot girl! What can you
do in your condition?!

290
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:40,402
[sobbing]

291
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,268
[Roy] He isn't home
yet?... I see...

292
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:46,668
I'll head straight to the
command center then...

293
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:49,402
Right... Goodbye.

294
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:49,835
[phone hanging up]

295
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:50,702
Let's go.

296
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:52,702
[Hawkeye] Right.

297
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:54,468
Go where?

298
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:56,268
I think now would be a
good time to find out

299
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:58,802
who we can trust
and who we can't.

300
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:01,302
What is it with you idiots?
You got a death wish?...

301
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:03,368
Your wounds haven't
begun to heal yet,

302
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:05,608
and you're already going out
looking for more trouble?

303
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,980
[Roy] For all we know, the
Fuhrer is a Homunculus.

304
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,826
I can't very well
ignore that. Besides...

305
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:15,792
We just left children out on a
battlefield to do our fighting.

306
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:18,152
If they're brave
enough to fight...

307
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:20,389
how can I just sit
here and wait?!

308
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:25,902
[car engine]

309
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:27,468
[Roy] What's so funny?

310
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:30,368
Oh... It's nothing, really.
I was just thinking...

311
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:31,902
Can you imagine the
look on Edward's face

312
00:17:31,902 --> 00:17:33,635
if he heard you
talking back there?

313
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,768
I was only repeating
what you already said.

314
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:39,402
I have to admit,
this is unexpected...

315
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:40,535
Given the situation,

316
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:42,768
this is fairly bold action
for you to take, Colonel.

317
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:45,768
Like hell it is... I'm just
getting the ball rolling,

318
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:49,668
nothing more... Besides...

319
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,368
<i>[Hughes] You need as
many people on your side</i>

320
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:55,402
<i>as you can get your
hands on now, Colonel.</i>

321
00:17:55,402 --> 00:17:56,835
It's taken long enough...

322
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:59,835
but I think I might finally
begin heeding his advice.

323
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:03,402
[car engine]

324
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:14,202
[Roy] Well, these are
either the gates to glory,

325
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:16,568
or the entrance way to Hell.

326
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:19,202
Wait here, Lieutenant...
If anything happens to me,

327
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,735
then at least you'll have a
chance of getting out alive.

328
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:22,535
[Hawkeye] No, sir.

329
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,302
[suprised grunt]

330
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,368
That was an order.

331
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:27,202
One that I cannot obey.

332
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:28,502
You're a stubborn one.

333
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:32,802
That's something you've
always known, sir.

334
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:36,302
All right... Will you stay here
if I promise to come back?

335
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:40,202
Yes... Happy hunting, sir.

336
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,302
[Raven] So you're Colonel
Roy Mustang, are you?

337
00:18:42,302 --> 00:18:45,235
I got a call from my wife
about you a while ago.

338
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:47,735
Lieutenant General
Raven... I'm sorry ...

339
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:50,235
I haven't had time to
introduce myself...

340
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:52,702
I've been... very busy
since my transfer.

341
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:55,568
It's not a problem...
Tell me...

342
00:18:55,568 --> 00:18:59,168
How is that old fox Grumman
doing these days, anyway?

343
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:01,368
The same as always sir.

344
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:02,702
[Grumman] Check.

345
00:19:02,702 --> 00:19:06,302
[Roy, sighing] That's eleven
losses in a row for me.

346
00:19:06,302 --> 00:19:08,368
Twelve, actually... But...

347
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:11,802
at least you put up a decent
fight this time around...

348
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:13,768
You were fine until you
were sure you'd won,

349
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:15,368
then you blew it.

350
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:17,268
So, I finished too weak.

351
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:19,902
Yes... You can't be
ruthless enough...

352
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:21,902
You're a lot like
Raven that way.

353
00:19:21,902 --> 00:19:24,668
[Roy] Lieutenant General
Raven? From Central?

354
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:27,502
He's an exceptional soldier,
but too sentimental...

355
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:29,268
From what I've
heard, he'll even

356
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,702
tend to his wounded
men himself...

357
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,168
which leaves his whole
line of command in disarray...

358
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:36,902
You don't deploy your king to
tend to the pawns, do you?

359
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:38,802
How dare he say something
like that about me!

360
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,368
I was transferred to Central
because of the compassion

361
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:43,902
I showed my men in
the line of duty!

362
00:19:43,902 --> 00:19:48,502
That border-dwelling old coot
should keep his trap shut!

363
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:49,768
Oh, uh.. sorry.

364
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:51,635
No, General, it's fine...

365
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,368
Actually, General
Grumman told me

366
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:54,735
that if that story
made you angry,

367
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,468
it meant you were still
a good and just man...

368
00:19:57,468 --> 00:20:00,235
and that you were the officer
one could come to for support...

369
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:04,635
in case of an emergency.

370
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:09,902
I can't believe it... That old
fox got me again, didn't he?

371
00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:12,502
[laughter]

372
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,602
[Raven] Oh, it's time
for my meeting.

373
00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,235
Come on. You can walk with me.

374
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:21,368
[Raven] Have you
adjusted to Central yet?

375
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:23,468
No... I find conversing
with the citizens

376
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:25,635
around here quite
difficult, actually.

377
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:27,735
It's a mistake to
dismiss the value

378
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:29,502
of the word on the
street, Colonel.

379
00:20:29,502 --> 00:20:32,735
[Roy] I know... But most of
it's just mindless drivel...

380
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:35,568
Like "Scar was seen
feeding a stray cat",

381
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,668
or "immortality has
been discovered."

382
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:42,702
Or maybe even that "Fuhrer
Bradley is a Homunculus."

383
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:44,902
Who knows?

384
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:47,635
[laughter]

385
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:50,268
I see.. You've got no
sense of humor, do you?

386
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:52,368
Are you certain you were
one of Grumman's men?

387
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:55,868
His sense of humor didn't
rub off on me much, sir.

388
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:57,602
[Raven] Well, At least
that bit of gossip

389
00:20:57,602 --> 00:21:00,235
will give us something
to talk about over tea.

390
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:01,202
[Roy] Huh?...

391
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:04,102
I couldn't possibly
attend something like...

392
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:14,635
[door closing]

393
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:19,202
[Raven] Go on... Tell
your little joke.

394
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:23,168
You know, the one about the
Fuhrer being a Homunculus...

395
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:26,402
Please, go ahead.

396
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:29,602
[Bradley] What, Colonel
Mustang?.. Cat got your tongue?

397
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:32,768
Let's suppose for a moment that
I was actually a Homunculus,

398
00:21:32,768 --> 00:21:37,535
as you say. Well now...
would that be so bad?

399
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:46,302
<i>[Roy] Ah... I understand
now, Hughes...</i>

400
00:21:46,302 --> 00:21:48,235
<i>When you said that
we were in trouble,</i>

401
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:51,302
<i>you didn't mean that danger
was closing in on us...</i>

402
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:54,835
<i>No... you meant the
danger was coming from us.</i>

403
00:21:56,435 --> 00:21:58,168
<i>[Roy] Well, Fullmetal,</i>

404
00:21:58,168 --> 00:22:01,635
<i>it looks like we've landed
ourselves in the pit of hell.</i>

405
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:08,402
Where am I?

406
00:22:11,535 --> 00:22:16,468
Blood?! What the--
What is this place?!

407
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:22,135
Al! Hey!... Is
anybody out there?!

408
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:28,268
[heavy breathing]

409
00:22:28,268 --> 00:22:31,868
Where in the hell am I?!

410
00:24:05,568 --> 00:24:07,735
<i>Do you feel driven to keep
searching for someone</i>

411
00:24:07,735 --> 00:24:11,268
<i>who is lost because you
fear to be left alone?</i>

412
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:13,435
<i>Or because you
have no choice?...</i>

413
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,502
<i>Because, even if you
cannot see them...</i>

414
00:24:15,502 --> 00:24:18,535
<i>you cannot believe
they are gone.</i>

415
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:22,368
<i>Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.</i>

416
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:26,402
<i>Episode 25...
Doorway of Darkness.</i>

417
00:24:26,402 --> 00:24:30,868
<i>The fight continues... inside
the belly of the beast.</i>
