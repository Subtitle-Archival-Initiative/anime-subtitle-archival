1
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:40,127
Ahh, man, am I beat.

2
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:42,194
Being spied on for
hours will do that.

3
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:44,894
Mr. Fu and Lan Fan
were keeping eyes on him?

4
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:46,227
[Fu] Hey!

5
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:48,194
Where's the Young Lord?

6
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:52,994
He's not here.

7
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:56,094
I don't know...
Maybe he ran off again.

8
00:01:57,794 --> 00:02:00,760
Good grief. I can't take my
eyes off him for a second.

9
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:06,527
Young Lord! Where have
you taken off to this time?

10
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,660
What if he's collapsed
somewhere again?

11
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,760
If so, I'd say it's
a relief... Let's go.

12
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,227
Coming!

13
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:20,060
Master Ling! Where are you?

14
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,727
Something about this
country doesn't feel right.

15
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:49,094
It's me... I'm Just checking in.

16
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:54,160
You're doing well...
Here, it's from the colonel.

17
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,060
Hey, it's the smokin' guy!

18
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,760
How's it goin'? You won
a single game yet?

19
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,827
Not even close... But this
game is boring anyway.

20
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:06,894
Hey, since it's night now,

21
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:08,960
I can go and cut
someone up, right?!

22
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
Of course not.

23
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,027
Ya gotta give me something'!

24
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:14,760
At least bring that
Hawkeye lady for a visit.

25
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,027
Yeah... I'll let her know
that you're interested.

26
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:18,760
He's not the only
one who's bored.

27
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,160
How much longer
am I stuck here

28
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,594
keeping watch on
this guy, anyway?

29
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:24,627
What does the colonel say?

30
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:26,660
The colonel apologizes
for having to give you

31
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,694
such a dangerous assignment.

32
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:30,760
He also says don't worry
about your other duties;

33
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,994
your absence is being
treated as sick leave.

34
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:35,127
But if anyone--

35
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:38,294
even military personnel outside
of our unit-- sees you,

36
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:40,794
he'll have you court-martialed
before you can blink...

37
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:43,727
That is all.

38
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:45,027
I don't suppose
you have any news

39
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:46,960
of a happier sort to report?

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,860
Indeed.

41
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,760
Oh? What is it?

42
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,627
Falman, I found
myself a girlfriend!

43
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:54,060
She's been really sweet,

44
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,160
helping me adjust to the
move here and everything.

45
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,027
And oh, boy is she hot!

46
00:03:58,027 --> 00:04:00,727
Hey, do you think this new
girl would be fun to cut up?

47
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:01,660
Come on, what d'ya say?

48
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,360
Can I cut her?
Just a little, I promise.

49
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,227
Please, just get out of here.

50
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:09,060
Hey... are you okay?

51
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,894
F- food...

52
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:13,694
Collapsed by the side
of the road, huh?

53
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:15,994
Where did you come from?

54
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:18,594
What's that?
From Xing, you say?

55
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,594
Well, you're a long way
from home, all right.

56
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,060
I'll need to see your
entry visa, please.

57
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,860
Outta the way, everyone!

58
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,127
Illegal alien coming through!

59
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:33,294
Young Master!
Where are you?!

60
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:37,260
He's in trouble again!
He's collapsed, I'm sure of it!

61
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,627
Okay... Guess we should stop
by the military offices first.

62
00:04:41,627 --> 00:04:42,927
Right.

63
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:43,960
In that case,

64
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,594
I think I'll head straight
to the Hughes' house

65
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:47,660
and let them know
I'm in town...

66
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,694
I can't wait to see Miss
Gracia and cute little Elicia!

67
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:53,894
Sounds good. We shouldn't
be all that far behind you.

68
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,960
'Kay, see ya later.

69
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:01,027
I wonder if Lt. Colonel Hughes

70
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:02,827
has put together
any more information

71
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:05,627
on the Philosopher's
Stone since we left.

72
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:09,227
The Fuhrer was pretty clear
with his orders regarding that.

73
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:10,860
I think it's best
if we give Hughes

74
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,960
the information
that we found out first.

75
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,527
The Homonculi.

76
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:16,994
Yeah.

77
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,127
I'm pretty sure Hughes said

78
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:22,027
he was in the
court-martial office.

79
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,694
This way.

80
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,127
[Female Officer] Sheska? Sheska!

81
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:45,194
Yes?

82
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:47,760
You have the key for room
number three, don't you?

83
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,627
Yes! Oh, wait! You said
room number three, right?

84
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:54,160
It's still a total mess from
when I was using it earlier!

85
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,260
It's fine...

86
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,827
I just need it to gather
some documents, that's all.

87
00:05:57,827 --> 00:05:59,094
No, really, please don't!

88
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:03,160
If you can just wait a moment,
I'll clean it right up for you!

89
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,760
Okay then... I can come
back later for the keys.

90
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,560
Please make sure
it's taken care of.

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,060
Yes, ma'am!

92
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:27,694
[Sheska] Um...
excuse me... Colonel?

93
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:29,994
Colonel Mustang?

94
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:35,160
Oh, hello Sheska...
How long was I asleep?

95
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,760
About ten minutes, I think.

96
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,760
The council meeting's
about to start.

97
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,260
Uh, Colonel... perhaps this is
none of my business, but...

98
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,260
but maybe you should try
to get a little more rest.

99
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,960
Mm-hmm, I'll be back.

100
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:58,160
Was that Colonel
Mustang that just left?

101
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,294
Oh! Captain Focker, sir!
Good morning!

102
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:02,627
Nice day, isn't it?

103
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:05,160
Good morning to you, Sheska...

104
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,260
Tell me... What was he
doing here? The colonel.

105
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,260
Ah... well... you see...

106
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,027
The storeroom door is open.

107
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:15,660
I'm sorry! I opened it, sir!

108
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,627
I'll bet the colonel twisted
your arm, didn't he?

109
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:20,794
Don't worry,
I won't tell anyone.

110
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:22,894
I really appreciate that, sir!

111
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:26,760
Although... I do wonder what
the colonel was looking into...

112
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,827
Do you know?

113
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:30,227
I'm not one hundred
percent certain

114
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:32,560
of all of the details, sir...

115
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,260
He did ask if there
were any materials

116
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,227
having to do with
the Fifth Laboratory...

117
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:42,094
And also... he was looking
into the Hughes case.

118
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:46,827
You know I... I got my job
here through General Hughes.

119
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:49,960
Ah, yes... I remember.

120
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:54,960
Well, I've got
tons of work to do.

121
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Carry on, Sheska.

122
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:00,027
Yes, sir.

123
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,527
Good morning, Sheska.

124
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:19,994
Sir?

125
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:21,927
What the--?

126
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,827
Hello, sir.

127
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:42,627
Hey.

128
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,894
Colonel... you look like
you've lost some weight.

129
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:53,094
Maybe...

130
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:54,994
But what happened to you?

131
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:58,594
There was an... incident...
down in the south.

132
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:00,894
But, don't you worry,
it's just a scratch.

133
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,060
I see.

134
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,160
I ran into the Elric
brothers down there.

135
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,127
Apparently they'd gone to
Dublith to pay a visit...

136
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:10,560
an old teacher.

137
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,294
Major...

138
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:13,794
Sir?

139
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:17,027
Did you tell them
about Hughes' death?

140
00:09:17,027 --> 00:09:20,160
No... I couldn't
bring myself to do it.

141
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,027
They'll find out,
eventually you know.

142
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:25,627
Yes, I know.

143
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:28,027
The Fifth Laboratory and
the Philosopher's Stone--

144
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:31,994
the Stone's key ingredients
are live humans.

145
00:09:31,994 --> 00:09:34,594
Hughes always did enjoy
helping other people...

146
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:35,760
This time he stuck his nose

147
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,994
into the Elric brothers'
investigation...

148
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,194
and found out something
he would've been

149
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:41,294
better off not knowing.

150
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:44,594
Am I wrong?

151
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:47,260
If the Elric brothers found out
what really happened to him...

152
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,294
that he died trying
to help them...

153
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:51,627
they would blame themselves...

154
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:55,894
So, your not telling
them... was kind.

155
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,960
You've got it all
figured out, don't you?

156
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,960
I'm almost there.

157
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,994
Be careful, sir.

158
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:09,094
You never know who might be
listening in on you... Or where.

159
00:10:09,094 --> 00:10:11,527
If you'll excuse me...

160
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:20,847
[Ed] Huh? Lieutenant Hawkeye?

161
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:25,514
Hey, guys. It's been awhile.

162
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,581
If the Lieutenant's here,
that means so is...

163
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:29,614
[Colonel Mustang]
Thanks for waiting.

164
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:30,881
Yep. The Colonel.

165
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,647
Well hello, Fullmetal.

166
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:35,214
Colonel Mustang, what are
you doing here in Central?

167
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,647
You didn't hear?
I was transferred

168
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:38,447
to this branch last month.

169
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:39,547
Great.

170
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:42,847
And you guys?
What brings you here?

171
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:45,647
We're just doing a little
information gathering...

172
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:46,847
And we were thinking
that we'd pay

173
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:50,214
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes
a visit a little later today.

174
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,181
Where is he, anyway?

175
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,247
Not here.

176
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:57,581
Huh?

177
00:10:57,581 --> 00:10:59,681
He retired, out in
the country...

178
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:02,714
and took his wife
and daughter with him...

179
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:05,514
to take over the
family business.

180
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:07,781
So, he's not here.

181
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:10,881
I see... well, that's too bad.

182
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:13,314
We were hoping to see him.

183
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:17,981
Fullmetal...

184
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:23,447
Watch yourself...
Don't do anything crazy.

185
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:25,481
Okay...

186
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:38,481
Now you've decided to
treat them like children?

187
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:41,314
There's no need for them
to know just yet...

188
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:44,381
The fewer obstacles that stand
in their way right now...

189
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:46,514
the better.

190
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:49,947
Colonel... They are
gonna find out someday.

191
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:55,447
It's funny... I've accused
Armstrong of being soft...

192
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:58,947
But right now I'm
no better than he is.

193
00:11:58,947 --> 00:12:02,514
I fail to see anything
"soft" about it.

194
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,981
It's cruel, Colonel.

195
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:07,647
I can't believe Hughes
is actually gone.

196
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:10,314
Oh! I almost
forgot, Brother...

197
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,314
We need to tell Winry
about all this...

198
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,747
She went straight
to the Hughes house.

199
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:15,947
Yeah, you're right.

200
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:20,547
Lieutenant Ross!

201
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:22,814
I haven't seen you
two here in awhile...

202
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:24,447
You're in a hurry.
Why the rush?

203
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,881
We just heard about
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes...

204
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,281
Yeah... It's rough news, huh?

205
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:34,381
There was still so much that
we wanted to tell him about.

206
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:37,481
We would have liked
to say goodbye.

207
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:39,881
We weren't able to reach you.

208
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:41,681
Don't worry though...

209
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:43,847
The military gave him
a proper send-off.

210
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,414
Wow, that was nice.

211
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:47,981
That's how it's done.

212
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,814
Also... If you boys
haven't heard already...

213
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:52,914
I'm sure you'll both
be glad to know...

214
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:55,914
he was promoted...
two whole ranks.

215
00:12:55,914 --> 00:12:57,914
Up to Brigadier General?

216
00:12:57,914 --> 00:13:01,614
He retired to the country
and they promoted him?

217
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:08,714
Lieutenant Ross?

218
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:16,847
<i>[Narrator]

219
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:22,427
<i>[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

220
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:28,984
And here you are, miss.

221
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:30,884
Thank you!

222
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:39,617
No! Not the Lieutenant
Colonel! Why him?!

223
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,251
Brother!

224
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:51,484
[Lt. Ross] Brigadier
General Hughes is dead...

225
00:13:51,484 --> 00:13:52,951
He was murdered
shortly after you were

226
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:55,484
discharged from the
hospital, Edward...

227
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:58,751
I'm afraid we still haven't
found the person responsible.

228
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:02,484
<i>It's all my fault...</i>

229
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:04,851
<i>I'm the one who
pulled him into this!</i>

230
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:06,817
<i>It's all my fault!!</i>

231
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,717
[Hughes] Okay, you boys
have a safe trip...

232
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:23,851
Stop in and give me a shout

233
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:25,617
the next time you
make it to Central.

234
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:27,451
Al, how're you gonna
eat wearing that armor?

235
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,717
Take it off, relax!

236
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:31,784
Elrics... I understand that you
two don't have a place to stay,

237
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:34,417
which means you'll
have to come with me.

238
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:53,617
Daddy!?

239
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,617
What do we do?

240
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:15,351
We tell it like it is.

241
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:16,917
You go on back...

242
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,684
I'm the only one who has to take
the blame for what happened.

243
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:21,984
Brother...

244
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:25,984
this isn't just your problem...
It's both of ours.

245
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:29,684
Like it or not,
I'm going in with you.

246
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:31,851
Thanks, Al... but you
really don't have t--

247
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:33,051
We made up our minds...

248
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:36,751
We said we were getting our
bodies back, no matter what.

249
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:39,551
But if people are going
to die because of that...

250
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:42,017
then I don't want mine back.

251
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:51,484
Winry's already here.

252
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,284
Right.

253
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:00,244
Winry...

254
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,244
Um, Miss Gracia...

255
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:10,410
I'm sorry, but there's something
I need to talk to you about...

256
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,510
If I may.

257
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,610
About Maes?

258
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,977
That's right...
You too, Winry.

259
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:20,824
[Miss Gracia] So Maes learned
things about the Philosopher's

260
00:16:20,824 --> 00:16:22,967
Stone that someone
didn't want him to know.

261
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,534
His death was a message...

262
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,734
A warning to you
from whoever did it...

263
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:30,067
to back off from all this.

264
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:34,134
Yeah, we basically
dragged him into it...

265
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:35,867
I'm sorry!

266
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,501
So sorry.

267
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:45,734
That would be just like him...

268
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:48,967
dying while trying to
help somebody else.

269
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:52,067
My husband. He always was
a busybody and a meddler,

270
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:55,767
and it got him into
trouble. A lot.

271
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:59,834
But you know... I don't
think he ever had regrets.

272
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:04,201
Not any... not even in his
dying moments, Edward.

273
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:07,034
But we...

274
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:10,001
Don't tell me you're
going to give up.

275
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:14,067
You can't let what
happened defeat you...

276
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:17,734
If you do, then that means
my husband died in vain.

277
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:22,567
Even if the Philosopher's
Stone is a dead end...

278
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:25,134
There might be some other way.

279
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,934
Maybe, I guess.

280
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:35,267
You boys have to keep moving
forward... any way you can.

281
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,267
[Elicia] Mommy...

282
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:45,567
Mommy, please don't cry.

283
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:47,734
Winry... you in there?

284
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:52,934
You haven't eaten
yet, have you?

285
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:56,767
You might want to hurry...
The dining room is closing soon.

286
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:01,801
You know you have to eat...
to keep up your strength.

287
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:07,501
Okay... I'll go back to my room.

288
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:14,001
[Ed] Apple pie?

289
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:17,701
That's right. I've practiced
making it a few times.

290
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:21,167
I know it might... sound
like... I'm bragging...

291
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,101
but I've gotten
pretty good at it.

292
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:26,834
I'm not nearly as good
as Miss Gracia, but someday...

293
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,667
I'd hoped...

294
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:34,967
That Mr. Hughes...
would get to try some too!

295
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,372
[Lust] So the nosy
Colonel Mustang

296
00:19:57,372 --> 00:19:59,339
is snooping around
the Hughes matter?

297
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:00,206
Mm-hmm.

298
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:03,072
Do you think he
discovered anything yet?

299
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:05,172
It's a definite possibility.

300
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,139
So what now?

301
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:10,206
We already moved him to Central

302
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:13,172
where we'd be able to
keep a closer eye on him.

303
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:16,106
Why can't he be a good boy
and behave himself?

304
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:18,972
I'd hate to waste an
important sacrifice candidate.

305
00:20:18,972 --> 00:20:20,672
Haven't been able
to learn anything

306
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:22,272
from your new boyfriend?

307
00:20:22,272 --> 00:20:23,272
[Lust] Nothing.

308
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:26,306
He's either a born idiot
or a clueless hustler.

309
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:30,039
I'm off to gather some
more intelligence.

310
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,672
Let's go, Gluttony.

311
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:38,906
Come on, Gluttony! Don't leave
your mess lying around.

312
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,939
You slob.

313
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:43,406
What you said before...

314
00:20:43,406 --> 00:20:45,072
about how much
nicer it would be

315
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:48,672
if the Flame Colonel
would behave himself...

316
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:49,972
Yes?

317
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:53,239
How would you feel about
us making another play?

318
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:56,939
You have something in mind?

319
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:58,772
Well, we've got a noisy mutt...

320
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:01,806
Perhaps all he needs
is a nice bone to chew on.

321
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:08,639
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross...

322
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:13,039
I'm Henry Douglas, from
the Provost Marshal's office.

323
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,339
Do you need me for something?

324
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,239
You'll have to come along
with us... Your gun?

325
00:21:22,206 --> 00:21:24,139
May I ask what this is about?

326
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:26,072
You've been named
as the primary suspect

327
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:30,839
in the Brigadier General Hughes
murder case. Please come along.

328
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:31,939
That's absurd!

329
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:36,039
You can tell your side
of it later... Now let's go.

330
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:41,206
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross...

331
00:21:41,206 --> 00:21:43,672
Pleading not guilty
on all charges.

332
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:46,372
Gather whatever information
you can about her...

333
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:49,339
Go now. Quickly...
but secretly.

334
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:51,039
Right.

335
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:02,339
S'cuse me, ma'am. I'd like
a bouquet of these, please.

336
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:06,106
My, my, what's this?
A hot date, lover boy?

337
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:24,039
You been waiting long, Solaris?

338
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,639
Oh, no... I just got here.

339
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:29,339
It's so good to
see you, Jean...

340
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:32,939
Why don't you sit down
and tell me all about your day?
