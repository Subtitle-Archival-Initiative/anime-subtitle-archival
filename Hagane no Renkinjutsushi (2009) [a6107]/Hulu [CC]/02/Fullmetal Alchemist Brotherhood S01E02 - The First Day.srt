00:00:01,011 --> 00:00:03,677
[Narrator] Alchemy--the
science of understanding,

2
00:00:03,677 --> 00:00:06,077
deconstructing, and
reconstructing matter.

3
00:00:06,077 --> 00:00:09,077
However, it is not an
all-powerful art.

4
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:12,044
It is impossible to create
something out of nothing.

5
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,044
If one wishes to
obtain something,

6
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:16,511
something of equal
value must be given.

7
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:19,011
This is the Law of
Equivalent Exchange...

8
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:22,077
the basis of all alchemy.
In accordance with this law,

9
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:24,077
there is a taboo
among alchemists.

10
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:26,777
Human transmutation is
strictly forbidden.

11
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,911
For what could equal the
value of a human soul?

12
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:04,276
[train whistle]

13
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:08,603
[Al] Brother...

14
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:11,037
[Al] The stories about
this priest in Liore...

15
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:12,370
you think they're true?

16
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,337
The ones about his "miracles"?

17
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:16,870
[Ed] They say he can transmute
flowers out of thin air, right?

18
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,970
Could just be sleight of hand,

19
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,303
some cheap trick like that...

20
00:02:20,303 --> 00:02:22,637
[Al] But, what if it's not?

21
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:25,637
Right... If it's not, then
I suppose all that leaves

22
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:27,270
is the real thing, huh?

23
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:30,337
[Ed, Age 11] The celestial stone
that destroyed the city of

24
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:33,837
<i>Xerxes in one night. The grand
elixir, sealed away by the</i>

25
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:36,703
<i>Eastern Sage.. It goes by
different names, but it's</i>

26
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,470
<i>always the same thing-</i>

27
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,403
<i>some kind of object that
amplifies alchemy.</i>

28
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:43,637
And that's the
Philosopher's Stone.

29
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:45,670
If we could just get our
hands on it somehow,

30
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,637
I might be able to get
your body back.

31
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:49,570
Damn books!

32
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,770
They tell us everything
but how to find it!

33
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,403
Al...

34
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:55,537
[Al] Yeah?

35
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:57,603
I think I have a good
feeling about this one.

36
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:59,803
[Al] Mm. Me too.

37
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,937
[Trisha] Ed? Al? Where are you?

38
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:07,003
Oh, you boys...

39
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:10,337
[Trisha] Are you in here messing
up your dad's study again?

40
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:13,003
And Ed, you know better than
to scribble on the floor.

41
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:15,303
Yeah...
but, it's not scribbling.

42
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:15,970
[Ed] Here, watch!

43
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,870
[electric shocks]

44
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,303
Oh, my...
that's alchemy, isn't it...

45
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,570
[Trisha] Did your dad
teach you that?

46
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,570
How can he teach
us anything if he's not here?

47
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,603
Right, we read about
it in these books.

48
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:30,637
I can't believe
you've done this.

49
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,803
I'm sorry, did
we mess up?

50
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:35,403
[Trisha] No, no!

51
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:37,903
It's great! You definitely
take after your father...

52
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:40,603
My little geniuses.
You make me so proud!

53
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:42,770
<i>[Ed] And that was it--
Mom had given us all</i>

54
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,003
<i>the encouragement we needed.
From that moment,</i>

55
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:47,237
<i>we were obsessed with
learning alchemy.</i>

56
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:51,570
[Ed] But then, in the summer of
that same year, an epidemic

57
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,837
swept the country. The sickness
came, and it took her.

58
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:01,337
Hey, brother...
I'm hungry, aren't you?

59
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,970
And it's cold here...
Let's go home, please?

60
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,803
Once dad comes back,
everything'll be--

61
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,903
[Ed] Don't even
talk about him!

62
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:14,537
That bastard doesn't care
about us. He's not our dad.

63
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:16,737
He didn't even come
for Mom's funeral.

64
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,570
[sad sigh]

65
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,770
You know there might be a way
we can bring mom back...

66
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,737
But I thought it said in
all the books that using

67
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,003
alchemy to make
people is something

68
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:32,770
you're not supposed
to do, ever.

69
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,437
That's right.. That's why
it'll be our secret.

70
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:38,737
[Winry] I thought
I'd find you here.

71
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,337
[Ed] What do want, Winry?

72
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:42,337
[Winry] You know what
my Grandma says...?

73
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:44,037
She says you shouldn't
cry for loved ones

74
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:46,670
who've passed away,
because when you do,

75
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,637
it makes them feel sad in
the next world, too.

76
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:50,770
[Ed] We're not crying!

77
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,437
[gasp]

78
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:55,337
And, who are you
to talk, anyway?

79
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,370
Every time your parents
go away somewhere,

80
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,870
you cry like a little baby!

81
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,470
I-I do not! I don't!

82
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,470
[Ed] Are you sure, baby?

83
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,037
[Winry] I'm so stupid for
worrying about you...

84
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:08,803
I'm going home to tell grandma
not to make you any dinner!

85
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:11,503
[Ed] Hey, what'cha gonna do
that for? Hold up!

86
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:12,903
[Al] Y-Yeah! Wait for us!

87
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:15,337
[All] Thanks for dinner!

88
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,937
[gulping]

89
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:20,870
[Granny] Come on, Ed.
Drink your milk, too.

90
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,870
[Ed] No. I hate milk.

91
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,870
If you don't drink it
you'll stay short forever.

92
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,637
[Ed] Y'mean like you,
you sawed-off old hag?!

93
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,670
What was that, you little
half-pint midget!

94
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,937
Shrunk down mini-witch!

95
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:30,937
Micro pee-wee!

96
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:31,970
Baby ant baby!

97
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,837
Sub-atomic shrimp!

98
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,337
[school bells]
ding ding... dong

99
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,470
[Winry] You were reading those
weird books in the middle

100
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,437
of class again. You need to pay
attention to the lessons.

101
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:43,337
[Ed] Leave us
alone, will ya'?

102
00:05:43,337 --> 00:05:45,470
[Winry] So-- what kind'a
books are they anyway?

103
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,570
It's a secret.

104
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,603
In other words, it's none'a
your damn business, Winry.

105
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:51,637
C'mon. No fair, you guys're
always keeping secrets.

106
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:53,437
[Al laughs]

107
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,637
[Al] Bye Winry!

108
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:59,470
[gasp] Hey! I forgot!
Grandma wanted me to tell you

109
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,803
she's making stew tonight!

110
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:01,970
Yay! Stew!

111
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,237
Right! We'll be there!

112
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,727
[Ed] Y'know, whoever invented
stew must've been a genius.

113
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,160
It's even got milk in it,
and it still tastes good!

114
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,394
So that makes it genius?

115
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:15,460
Someone came up with the idea to
pour milk into vegetable soup

116
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,494
for the first time, right?
That's a leap of imagination--

117
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:20,694
the kind a scientist needs
to be able to make, too.

118
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,060
I dunno, I guess that's true...

119
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,794
Sure it is! Just one leap,
that's all it takes!

120
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:27,094
And it's what we need to figure
out human transmutation.

121
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:30,460
[Ed] And so, we began searching
for the key that would unlock

122
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,894
<i>the secrets of human
transmutation and</i>

123
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,627

teacher, to prepare our</i>

00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:40,427
<i>bodies as well as our minds.</i>

126
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:44,094
<i>It took years of constant
effort, but we wanted to see</i>

127
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:48,127
Mom's smile again. We wanted to
go back to our lives with her

128
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:52,394
the way they used to be. That's
what drove us, day and night.

129
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:56,127
[optimistic, yet ominous
music playing]

130
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:02,860

140
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:36,394
And finally... we need
some soul data.

OK, this is it, Al.

I doing? I just...

Who are you?

Oh, I am so glad
you asked...

[Truth] I am called by many
names. I am the world.

I am the universe. I am God...
I am Truth... I am all...

<i>was being poured into
my brain at once.</i>

174
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:31,394
It's too much...!
It's too much! Make it stop!

175
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:34,860
[screams]

176
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,894
[Ed] What's happening to me?
Stop it! Make it stop!

177
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:42,760
Make it stop!

178
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,794
<i>[Ed] My head felt like it was
about to burst, but for an</i>

179
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:49,927

The truth. Of everything.</i>

180
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:53,127
Mom... Mom, please!

181
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:00,427
[fumbly breath]

182
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,660
[Truth] How was it?

183
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,527
I see...

184
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:09,427
My theory of human
transmutation wasn't wrong...

185
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:11,694
It can be done.
It's possible...

186
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,694
It's still just
missing something...

187
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:15,994
[Ed] All of the answers
I need are right here!

188
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:18,627
The truth about human
transmutation!

189
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:21,427
[Ed] Please! You have to
show it to me again!

190
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:23,060
I can't do that.

191
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,494
[Truth] I've already
shown you all

192
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:26,660
I can for the toll you've paid.

193
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,194
Toll? What toll?

194
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,760
This... Surely you knew?

195
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,860
[gasp]

196
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,494
[Truth] It's the law of
equivalent exchange

197
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:40,560
Right...? Young alchemist...?

198
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,660
[screaming]

199
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,660
[Ed] Dammit! This can't be
happening! It can't be!

200
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,527
This wasn't... This wasn't
supposed to... NO!

201
00:10:57,527 --> 00:11:00,660
He's gone! What have I done?!

202
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:07,660
Somebody help me... Somebody...
Please, Mom... Mom, please...

203
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,094

204
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:11,794

205
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:18,927
[syrupy breath]

206
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,027
No... this... this is
wrong... this isn't...

207
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:29,760
this isn't what we wanted!

208
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,994
Al... Alphonse...
Alphonse! Alphonse!

209
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,794
This is all my fault...!

210
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:41,627
Al-phonse-No!

211
00:11:41,627 --> 00:11:45,160
No, dammit! You won't
take him, too!

212
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,127
Give him back...
He's my brother!

213
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:50,494
Take my leg! Take my arm!

214
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:53,627
Take my heart! Anything!
You can have it!

215
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:56,794
Just give him back!
He's my little brother!

216
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:58,527
He's all I have left!

217
00:11:58,527 --> 00:11:59,860
[electric eagle screech]

218
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,100
[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.

219
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,534
[Hughes] Roy!
Hey, you're still in Central?

220
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,400
For now, anyway.
They're shipping me back to

221
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,667
Eastern Command this afternoon.

222
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,567
Well now, aren't you the lucky
one. Next time you come here,

223
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,400
I expect you to have made
Brigadier General.

224
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,734
You got that?

225
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,534
[Roy] Easy for you to say.

226
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,000
[Hughes laughs]

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,600
Oh... by the way...
if you're leaving,

228
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,367
I'll go ahead and
give this to you.

229
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:29,200
What is it?

230
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
Something you might
find interesting.

231
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,500
The final report on
Isaac McDougal.

232
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,400
[Hughes] I'm guessing it hasn't
reached your office yet.

233
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,500
No.

234
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:39,834
[surprised choke]

235
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:42,234
"Xingese Alkahestry",
what's that?

236
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:44,234
[Hughes] Apparently, that's
something they have...

237
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:46,667
To be honest, no idea.
You don't know it?

238
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,567
No, it's the first
I've heard of it.

239
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,167
So, how are the
Elrics doing?

240
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,567
You keepin' those
boys out of trouble?

241
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:55,534
I'm their commanding officer,
not their father.

242
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:56,800
Hmm.

243
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,634
Hey... tell me somethin', Roy.
Why did you decide to make Ed

244
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:04,034
a State Alchemist anyway?
He's just a kid...

245
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,600
I mean, military life isn't easy
you know. That boy's gonna

246
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,667
have to go through hell someday.

247
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,567
You and I have certainly
seen our share.

248
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:18,400
<i>[Roy, thinking] Hell, huh?</i>

249
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,167
<i>Oh, they've seen hell...</i>

250
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,500
<i>Both of them...
and plenty of it.</i>

251
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,200
[epic strings]

252
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,500
[Hawkeye] Lieutenant Colonel...

253
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,667
They're not in back, either.

254
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:36,700
What is this...?

255
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,734
Where are they?
Where are the Elric brothers?

256
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:41,200
I want them found!

257
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:47,167
[Granny] Oh, hush, Den. Don't
bark at our guests... Yes...?

258
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,667
[Granny] Hey,
what is this?!

259
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,300
You have no reason to
come barging in here!

260
00:13:56,734 --> 00:14:00,400
We went to your house! We saw
the floor! What was that?!

261
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,667
[Roy] What did you do?!

262
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:06,000
[shaky breath]

263
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
[Al] We're sorry...
We didn't mean it...

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,534
[Al] We're sorry...
We're sorry... We're sorry...

265
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:17,267
Wait-- are you...?

266
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:19,667
[Roy] This is a surprise,
to say the least...

267
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,367
[Roy] I'd heard reports
that there was a brilliant

268
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:24,267
alchemist living in this town,
so I came to check them out...

269
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:26,667
The last thing I expected
to find was a boy skilled

270
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,400
enough to attempt human transmutation...

271
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,267
Or advanced enough to bond
a soul to a suit of armor.

272
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,267
[Roy] I'd say he's more
than qualified to

273
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:38,134
become a State Alchemist.

274
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:41,134
Should he choose to accept the
position... he will be required

275
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:44,134
to serve the military in times
of national emergency.

276
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,534
In return, he'll receive
privileges and access

277
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:49,734
to otherwise restricted
research materials...

278
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,034
Given time, they may be
able to find a way

279
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:55,267
to get their bodies back...
or even more...

280
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:58,267
Right after he came stumbling to
my door, half-dead and covered

281
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:01,300
in blood... I went over to
their house to see for myself

282
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,500
what had happened...
What was there...

283
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:08,234
Whatever that thing was,
it wasn't human!

284
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:10,367
[Granny] Alchemy that
created that abomination.

285
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,434
It nearly killed them!

286
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:14,334
And you want to throw those
boys headlong into it?!

287
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,167
Would you really have
them go through

288
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,567
that kind of hell again?

289
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,267
[Winry] Some tea?

290
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes... Thanks.

291
00:15:29,134 --> 00:15:31,500
Say, um... Lieutenant?

292
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,400
Just "Riza", please... It's Riza
Hawkeye. Nice to meet you.

293
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:45,234
[Winry] Lieutenant Riza... have
you ever had to shoot anyone?

294
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,234
Yes, I have.

295
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,100
I hate what you soldiers do...

296
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,267
Soldiers like you are the
reason my mom and dad

297
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:54,700
left during the war,
and soldiers are

298
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,300
the reason they're dead.

299
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,067
And now you-- now you're here to
take Ed and Al away, too...

300
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,734
[Hawkeye] If they go,
that decision will be theirs,

301
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,067
and theirs alone.

302
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:10,134
Yes... It's entirely
up to them now.

303
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:12,000
[Roy] I'm not forcing you.

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,167
I'm merely offering
you the possibility.

305
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,334
Whether to move forward
or stay still...

306
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:18,534
Will you sit in that chair
wallowing in self-pity?

307
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:20,600
Or will you stand up
and seize the chance

308
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,800
the military can give you?

309
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,267
[Hawkeye] ...it's their choice.
They choose their own path.

310
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,734
[Roy] If you believe the
possibility exists for

311
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,700
getting your bodies back,
you should seek it out.

312
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,534
Keep moving, whatever
it takes...

313
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:35,367
Even if the way ahead...
lies through a river of mud.

314
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,234
[Winry] Miss Riza...
Why did you become a soldier?

315
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:47,367
[sigh]

316
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,600
[Hawkeye] Because there's
someone I have to protect.

317
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,167
[gasp]

318
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,167
[door creaking open]

319
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:53,734
[footsteps]

320
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:54,667
We're leaving.

321
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:55,934
[Hawkeye] Yes, sir.

322
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:01,700
[Hawkeye] Well, I guess
this is goodbye, young lady.

323
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,967
It's Winry.

324
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,434
Right... Bye, Winry.

325
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:10,367
[hands clasping]

326
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,400
[Hawkeye] I hope we
meet again someday.

327
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,000
[Hawkeye] Will they be coming?

328
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,267
[Roy] They'll come.

329
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:20,400
[Hawkeye] That boy. I've never
seen anyone look so defeated...

330
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,534
That's what you saw?

331
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:26,500
[Roy] No... There was
fire in those eyes.

332
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,267
[train whistle]
chugga chugga chooooo

333
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
[Granny] You're sure you
won't regret this?

334
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,200
[Ed] Hmm... My mind's made up.

335
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,500
How long will the surgery
and rehabilitation take?

336
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,000
I'd say about three years,
more or less...

337
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,634
I'll do it in one.

338
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:47,767
[gasps]

339
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,567
You'll have yourself spitting
blood, you know that?

340
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Al... just hang in there a
little longer, okay?

341
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,300
Then we're gonna get you your
body back, I promise.

342
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,567
Right. And while we're at it,
we'll get yours back, too.

343
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:07,434
[inspiring chamber music]

344
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:10,067
[fight sounds]

345
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,400
[Al] Seems like
you're in perfect shape.

346
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,100
Yeah... Now I need to
try some alchemy...

347
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,167
I guess it's been a while since
the last time I used it...

348
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,334
I know...

349
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:26,667
Not since the night we tried
to bring mom back, right?

350
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,000
[slow inhale]

351
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,034
[hands clapping]

352
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,534
[electrical magic shimmer]

353
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:32,500
Brother...!

354
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,400
Yeah... I'd say that's
right on the money...

355
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,600
[Al] No, it's amazing!
You didn't even use a

356
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,267
transmutation circle!
You perform alchemy

357
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,734
the same way that
Teacher does!

358
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,600
You can do it
too, can't you?

359
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,500
[Al] Me? No.
No way!

360
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
So you didn't see
it, did you.

361
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,534
[Al] See what?

362
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:52,667
Uhh... nevermind.

363
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:53,534
[wham]

364
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,400
Hey! You...! Don't mess
up my automail!

365
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,600
You know how hard
I worked on that?!

366
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,234
[Ed] Hell, if it's half
as hard as you

367
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:00,000
throw a wrench I'd
be surprised.

368
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:01,534
[groan]

369
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:03,700
For real... you could try
acting more like a girl

370
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,400
and less like a gearhead...

371
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,134
You think I'm a
gearhead, that's fine!

372
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:08,734
But you had better
get used to it!

373
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:10,634
'Cause, as long as you're
wearing my automail,

374
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:14,234
you're stuck with this gearhead
whether you like it or not!

375
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:15,334
Huh...?

376
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:21,803
[Subordinate]
It's unusual for you

377
00:19:21,803 --> 00:19:23,803
to observe the
examinations, sir.

378
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:26,136
[Bradley] That's true. But
I hear we have a 12-year-old

379
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:28,769
boy taking the test... I thought
I would come out and see

380
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:30,936
what all the
excitement was about.

381
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:34,936
Ah... Would that be a
steel prosthetic?

382
00:19:34,936 --> 00:19:37,569
Happened during the
Eastern Conflict.

383
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:41,136
[Bradley] I see. So you had a
rough time of it in Ishval, hm?

384
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:43,869
Who's he?

385
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:45,569
You idiot. That's
His Excellency,

386
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:47,803
Fuhrer King Bradley.

387
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:49,836
Hmm...

388
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:52,736
[Bradley] Thank you. You may
proceed with the examination.

389
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:56,903
Do you need something to draw
transmutation circles with?

390
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:58,869
[Ed] No, that's ok.
I've got it.

391
00:19:58,869 --> 00:19:59,903
[hands clapping]

392
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:01,036
[chugging adventure strings]

393
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,036
He's not even using a
transmutation circle.

394
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,169
[electric shocks]

395
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,003
[surprised gasps]

396
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:21,136
My, that's quite
something, isn't it?

397
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:23,336
[running footsteps]

398
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:24,503
[Officer] The Fuhrer!

399
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:30,503
You know, there are some people
who would see this as a good

400
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:33,136
way to assassinate a VIP...
In the future, you might

401
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:36,169
want to rethink the way you
conduct these examinations.

402
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:44,836
That's good... You clearly have
nerves of steel young man.

403
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:47,836
But, I'd say you still have much
to learn about the world.

404
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,469
Huh?

405
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:50,636
[metal breaking]

406
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:51,903
[gasp]

407
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:53,003
[screaming]

408
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,836
[Bradley] You put on quite
a show, my naiÃ ̄ve young

409
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:58,636
alchemist. Good luck with
the rest of your exam.

410
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:02,636
When did he draw his sword?

411
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:04,969
[wind blowing]

412
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:10,603
[Al] I wonder if Ed's doing
alright on his exam...

413
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,069
[Winry] Say, Al...?

414
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:14,436
[Al] Yeah? What is it?

415
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:17,203
[Winry] If Ed does become
a State Alchemist...

416
00:21:17,203 --> 00:21:19,403
does that mean you'll
be going away?

417
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:22,936
[Al] Yeah...

418
00:21:25,003 --> 00:21:26,603
[Roy] This silver pocket
watch will serve

419
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:29,003
as proof of your state certification.

420
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:31,869
[Roy] This envelope contains
your certificate of appointment.

421
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:34,569
Heh... And it would
seem our Fuhrer is

422
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:36,003
not without a certain
sense of irony.

423
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,103
Why's that?

424
00:21:37,103 --> 00:21:40,003
[Roy] Nothing. Congratulations.
You've just officially

425
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,069
become a Dog of the Military.

426
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,803
[Ed] By order of Fuhrer King
Bradley, this document

427
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,069
[Ed & Bradley] ...certifies
that Edward Elric has been

428
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:49,469
appointed to the post
of State Alchemist,

429
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:51,169
[Bradley] ...and that he is
hereby granted the title of

430
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:52,736
"Fullmetal".

431
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:55,603
Fullmetal?

432
00:21:55,603 --> 00:21:57,536
That's right... Along
with their commission,

433
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:59,903
State Alchemists also
receive a code name...

434
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,769
Officially, you will
now be known as...

435
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,736
[Roy] ..."The Fullmetal
Alchemist"

436
00:22:06,136 --> 00:22:09,136
I like that... It's nice
and intimidating...

437
00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:12,603
I think that'll suit
me just fine.

438
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,836
[thundering train sounds]
chugga chugga

439
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:20,036
[Al] Hey... Wake up.
We're almost there.

440
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:21,069
[waking sighs]

441
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:26,636
[Ed] So that's Liore...

442
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,003
[ <i>thinking</i> ] Could it really be
there? The key to finally

443
00:22:29,003 --> 00:22:31,603
getting Al his body back...

444
00:22:31,603 --> 00:22:33,036
The Philosopher's Stone!

445
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:07,736
<i>[Narrator] Having arrived in
Liore, Ed and Al encounter</i>

446
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:10,169
<i>Father Cornello, a priest
who claims he can perform</i>

447
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:13,903
<i>miracles. Blinded by false
promises of eternal life</i>

448
00:24:13,903 --> 00:24:16,836
<i>and resurrection for the dead,
Cornello's followers fail</i>

449
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:19,569

450
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:21,903

451
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:25,103
<i>Next time, on Fullmetal

00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:28,103
<i>Episode 3. City of Heresy.</i>

453
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:30,436
<i>What happiness
can possibly be gained</i>

454
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,769
by looking away from the truth?
