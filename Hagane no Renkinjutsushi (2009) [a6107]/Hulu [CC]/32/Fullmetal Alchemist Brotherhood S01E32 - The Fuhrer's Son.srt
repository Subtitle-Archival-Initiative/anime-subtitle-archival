00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,443
[ED]
Yea, you're right...

2
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:36,443
[AL]
It does look like her...

3
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:46,709
[OLDER WOMAN]
She's a darling girl, isn't she?

4
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,276
That's definitely not her!

5
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,543
[AL]
Yeah, I know!

6
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,276
We can't afford to
waste our time here

7
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:55,443
humoring some old
lady and her stupid cat.

8
00:01:57,309 --> 00:01:58,676
[AL] Come on...

9
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:01,043
[ED and AL]
Where are you hiding?

10
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:19,272
[ANNOUNCER]
East City...! East City!

11
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:28,905
We received new intel on Scar.

12
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:30,439
[MILITARY POLICE B]
He's still running, then?

13
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,639
Does he never give up?

14
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:34,805
[smacks]
Ah!

15
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,239
Oh, I'm terribly sorry
about that, dearie.

16
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,705
No ma'am. It was
my fault, really.

17
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,805
That's an interesting
outfit you're wearing...

18
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:47,372
Where're you from, dear?

19
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:49,272
Xing, actually.

20
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:52,239
Is that right?
You're here sightseeing?

21
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,505
There's not much to
look at in East City.

22
00:02:55,505 --> 00:02:58,872
[MAY] No, I'm just here
transferring trains.

23
00:02:58,872 --> 00:03:00,105
I'm heading north right now.

24
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:02,405
[ANNOUNCER] The train bound
for North City is departing...

25
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:04,305
Oh, that's me!

26
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:06,639
Thank you, for all
your help, ma'am!

27
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,505
Take care, dearie.

28
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,572
I've never seen
a cat like that.

29
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,439
[CAPTAIN]
Which way did he go?

30
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,572
[MILITARY POLICE C]
I know I heard footsteps

31
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:47,605
coming from over that way.

32
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:53,372
[CAPTAIN]
Look! Over there!

33
00:03:57,205 --> 00:04:01,839
[rumbling]

34
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:04,339
[crashes]

35
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,605
[KIMBLEE] He was seen
with a middle aged man

36
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,639
who had black hair, right?

37
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,472
Yes... that's what it
said in the report, sir.

38
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:23,539
[KIMBLEE]
And this was yesterday.

39
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,272
[KIMBLEE]
West, huh...

40
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:31,172
Several of our own
people were injured

41
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:33,372
while trying to apprehend him.

42
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:36,272
[KIMBLEE] Scar must
be getting desperate.

43
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:39,205
But that could help us...

44
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:41,539
He's leaving us a good trail.

45
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:50,139
[KIMBLEE] All right...
It's time to get to work.

46
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:20,705
A suspicious woman...
But that isn't my job.

47
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:31,139
[bell tolling]

48
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:43,172
[GRUMMAN] Looks like
a funeral procession.

49
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,572
Well... this is
the place for it.

50
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:48,405
It's quite depressing...

51
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,172
When you reach my age...

52
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:52,639
you think about it
being you in the box...

53
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,772
instead of watching it go by.

54
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,272
Surely you can't worry
too much about that...

55
00:05:57,272 --> 00:05:59,805
You still look
plenty young to me.

56
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,472
General Grumman, is that you?!

57
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:11,705
[GRUMMAN]
The plan was to meet

58
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,672
in front of General
Hughes' grave, wasn't it?

59
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:19,305
I thought the situation
must be serious

60
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:21,905
for you to resort to
the last-ditch plan...

61
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:25,639
so, just to be safe...
I wore a disguise.

62
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,705
Of course...

63
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:29,239
Now I see why you're
known for being eccentric...

64
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,905
That really is some get-up, sir.

65
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:32,539
Eccentric...?

66
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,172
I think I'll choose to
take that as a compliment...

67
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:38,705
Now... what is it you need?

68
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,239
[AL]
Alkahestry...

69
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,839
Maybe they have some
information in the library.

70
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,805
[ED]
Yeah...

71
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,939
If we can't find that
bratty little girl,

72
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,205
I don't see what
other choice we have.

73
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,472
[AL]
I hope we can at
least find something.

74
00:06:58,796 --> 00:06:59,627
[GRUMMAN]
I see.

75
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:03,627
The Central senior staff
have all turned, have they?

76
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,027
You've gained some information,

77
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:07,994
but you've lost
too much doing it.

78
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,561
With all the
people you can trust

79
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:13,027
stripped away from you,
you won't get anywhere.

80
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:17,461
[ROY] Yes... You've
got it exactly, sir.

81
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:20,127
[GRUMMAN]
Even Raven, too?

82
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,727
Not too long ago...

83
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:24,761
I came to Central and
he asked me something...

84
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,727
something I found quite strange.

85
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:30,594
He wanted to know
if I'd be interested

86
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:32,861
in a core of immortal soldiers.

87
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:34,827
Immortals?

88
00:07:36,527 --> 00:07:38,961
<i>[ROY thinking]
Did he mean Homunculi?</i>

89
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:42,394
The idea of immortality
is simply ridiculous...

90
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:45,727
I told him as much and
ended the conversation...

91
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:48,727
And not long after that,
I was transferred.

92
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,961
You mean you were demoted?

93
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,761
Indeed I was, and since then,

94
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:54,727
I've been stuck with
the inglorious job

95
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:57,794
of cleaning up the messes
in the Eastern area.

96
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:59,661
And speaking of messes...

97
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:03,694
Do you remember the difficulties
that we had in Loire?

98
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:06,561
A false priest was
scheming for power...

99
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:09,827
until the Fullmetal
Alchemist uncovered his plan.

100
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:12,027
[GRUMMAN]
Yes... I remember.

101
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,127
[ROY] Liore fell into
chaos after that...

102
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:18,694
but from the outset...

103
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:21,027
forces from the
East acted quickly...

104
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:23,794
They brought the
uprising under control...

105
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,461
Yes... but then the forces
from Central came in...

106
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:30,727
and all of the Eastern
forces were dismissed...

107
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:32,461
Were you aware of that?

108
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:37,761
Yea. And the peace in
Loire was shattered...

109
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:41,461
<i>After</i> the Central
forces appeared.

110
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:43,061
What are they
planning now...?

111
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:45,727
And what is it they
intend to do next...?

112
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,794
And why can't they hold off...?!

113
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,094
I'm almost retired...!

114
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:52,061
If they'd only wait,
I'd be free and clear.

115
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:54,661
Now I know that you're bluffing.

116
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:57,627
I'm sorry General,
but someone like you...?

117
00:08:57,627 --> 00:09:00,127
You don't know how
to sit by and watch...

118
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:02,394
You can't do nothing.

119
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:05,594
Especially when your soldiers
are all hardened veterans...

120
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:08,561
men who fought in
the Ishval conflict.

121
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:15,394
I expected you to
come crying to me.

122
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:16,294
When you sent me that note,

123
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,861
I thought you just
wanted some advice.

124
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:21,027
But you're trying to get
me involved in this too,

125
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,527
aren't you?

126
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,694
And you know, it's working...

127
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:25,927
Since things are becoming

128
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:28,561
so interesting over
at Central Command...

129
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,127
Just when I thought
my ambition was dead...

130
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:34,627
I'm finding myself
fired up again!

131
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:35,561
Careful now.

132
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:37,427
You don't want to
mess up your make up...

133
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:38,461
Right, ma'am?

134
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,627
Oh my, no!

135
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,894
Do you have an
opening later, sir...?

136
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:47,161
Maybe you and I could
grab a cup of tea somewhere.

137
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:48,761
Very sorry, but no.

138
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:51,494
I appreciate the invitation.

139
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:07,594
[ED]
No use.

140
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:09,427
Why is there so
little information

141
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:11,894
available on alkahestry?

142
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:13,961
At this rate,

143
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,761
I'm thinking we might
as well just go to Xing...

144
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:17,727
It'd be hard...

145
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,027
Crossing the desert
in automail sounds hot.

146
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:26,094
W-What the--?!

147
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,694
Ah ha...

148
00:10:32,194 --> 00:10:34,161
There you are, Edward Elric.

149
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:36,527
I've found you!

150
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:38,794
You?! Dammit Major,
what do you want?!

151
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:40,861
Shh! This is a
library, you know...

152
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:44,127
Quiet!

153
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:46,561
I understand you're after
a certain Xingese girl

154
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:49,761
who possesses a strange
black and white cat.

155
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:53,027
[ED] Yeah... But how
do you know that?

156
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,394
[ARMSTRONG]
Colonel Mustang informed me...

157
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:57,461
I'm running errands
for him today.

158
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:01,727
The word is the
girl is headed north.

159
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,494
According to an eyewitness,

160
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:07,094
she departed by train
from East City very recently.

161
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:09,427
North, huh...?

162
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:12,094
Now that's some
information I can act on!

163
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:13,894
I appreciate it, Major...

164
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,894
and thank the
Colonel for me, too.

165
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:19,561
Hold on a second...
There's more.

166
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,427
Take this.

167
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:25,394
[ED]
What is it?

168
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,927
[ARMSTRONG]
A letter of introduction...

169
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:31,727
but it might not be much use.
First thing, see her.

170
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:34,394
Her who...? What d'ya mean?

171
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,694
[ARMSTRONG] Even further north
than Northern Command...

172
00:11:38,694 --> 00:11:40,594
You'll find an officer nicknamed

173
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:44,627
the Northern Wall of Briggs
who defends our border.

174
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:47,761
Major General Armstrong.

00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:04,724
[blowing whistles]

178
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:10,858
[SCAR]
Hurry!

179
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,358
There's no escape
for you now, Scar!

180
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:42,791
[MILITARY POLICE F]
Where are they?!

181
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:47,558
Report to command.

182
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,524
They jumped on a train
bound for West City.

183
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,958
Damn!

184
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,924
[AL] I can't find any
details about alkahestry!

185
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:01,891
That May girl's use
of long-range alchemy

186
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:03,858
was pretty impressive.

187
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,624
I wish we could use it...

188
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:07,124
I should have asked
her more about it

189
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:09,858
when we were at
Dr. Knoc's place.

190
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:16,124
Ling did say it was specialized
for the medical field.

191
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:23,124
You're wearing a
full suit of armor.

192
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:26,124
Does that mean you're the
Fullmetal Alchemist's brother?!

193
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:28,124
Uh... Yeah, I am.

194
00:13:28,124 --> 00:13:29,858
Awesome!

195
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:36,124
Thanks... but maybe you
should be a bit quieter...

196
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:37,858
Oh... I'm sorry.

197
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,424
So... what're you
studying? Something cool?

198
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:43,091
It's called alkahestry.

199
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,891
What's alkahestry?

200
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,624
It's alchemy from
the country Xing.

201
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:50,524
Oooh... It's from Xing, huh...?

202
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:52,791
But you and your brother
are already good enough

203
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,824
at alchemy to practice
here in Amestris.

204
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,058
Our country's a major
alchemical power, isn't it?

205
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:59,758
We've got all sorts
of talented alchemists.

206
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:01,391
So why would you guys look into

207
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:05,691
the kind of alchemy they
practice in a foreign country?

208
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:07,458
<i>[AL thinking] I can't tell
him I'm trying to find a way</i>

209
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,991
<i>to get my body back,</i>

210
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:10,524
<i>or that we need
to figure out how</i>

211
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:12,491
<i>to fight against
the homunculi...</i>

212
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:14,791
<i>So what am I supposed to say?</i>

213
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:15,924
Well...

214
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:18,958
Alkahestry's supposed to
have a lot of medical uses...

215
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,758
So, I'm just
doing some research

216
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:22,724
to see if any of its
properties can be used

217
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:25,524
to save people's lives.

218
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:26,658
Oh, wow...!

219
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,424
That's just what I would
expect an Elric brother to say!

220
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:31,958
[ED]
Al! Hey, Al!

221
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,091
Get ready. We're leaving!

222
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:37,158
[AL] Quiet, brother.
This is a library...!

223
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:38,891
So, where are we going?

224
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,091
Look, don't worry about it.

225
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,591
I'll tell you
everything on the way...

226
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,124
For now, let's
just get moving...

227
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:45,658
First, we'll need to
stop by the hotel...

228
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:47,724
Hey, who is this kid?

229
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,191
Mr. Armor called you "brother."

230
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:53,724
Does that mean you're Edward
Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist?

231
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:54,591
Yeah.

232
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:55,291
Aw, cool...!

233
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,891
You are a tiny little alchemist,

234
00:14:56,891 --> 00:14:58,724
just like everyone says!

235
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:01,491
What was that...?

236
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:03,424
You... brat...
Say it again...!

237
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:07,458
Once... more...
I'll send you flying...!

238
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,458
Hear me...?

239
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,691
Your little body'll go
straight out into space!

240
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:11,791
That's true, too!

241
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:15,424
You hate being called small,
just like everyone says!

242
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:19,558
Step away from Master Selim.

243
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:22,424
[SELIM]
No, wait...! Don't shoot him

244
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:24,058
Uh, "Master Selim?"...

245
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:25,824
Are you Selim Bradley?

246
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,724
[AL]
Selim, the Fuhrer's son?

247
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:30,724
Yeah... that's me!

248
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:40,824
How did this happen...?

249
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:43,157
We were supposed
to be heading north!

250
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:44,991
[AL]
Don't look at me!

251
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:46,924
[MOTHER]
I'm so sorry.

252
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:48,324
It's just that
Selim's been in awe

253
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:50,424
of you for such a
long time, Edward.

254
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:52,757
Huh...? Me, really?

255
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:55,357
[AL] Selim... are you
interested in alchemy?

256
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:56,324
Yes...!

257
00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:58,824
My dream is to learn
how to practice it...

258
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,924
And after that,

259
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:02,457
I want to become a State
Alchemist just like you, Ed.

260
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:04,424
Awwww. Just like me?

261
00:16:04,424 --> 00:16:08,024
And then I'll be able to
help my father out, as well!

262
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:13,857
Yea, Fuhrer Bradley...

263
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:14,691
Tell me, Selim.

264
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,291
Do you get along
with your father...?

265
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,291
You like him?

266
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,891
Yeah, of course!

267
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:22,191
[ED]
And what kind of man is he?

268
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,457
An amazing man...!

269
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:27,024
His job is more demanding than
anybody else's in the world...!

270
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:28,124
He spends all day,

271
00:16:28,124 --> 00:16:31,824
every day thinking about
the people of this country.

272
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,791
Of course he does.

273
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,991
[AL] The Fuhrer's duties must
keep him very busy all the time.

274
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,091
That is true...

275
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:42,257
It's something he
always insists upon...

276
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:45,124
He's determined to
work himself ragged.

277
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:49,191
At his age, I'd prefer if
he took it a little easier.

278
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:50,291
It's nothing new...

279
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,424
He's always been
devoted to his work...

280
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:55,157
That's what he's good at...

281
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:57,191
but then where
women are concerned...

282
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:59,291
I'm afraid he's
a bit of an oaf.

283
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,857
The first time we met,

284
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:04,724
he made me so angry
I actually slapped him.

285
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,391
But it worked out for the best.

286
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,757
He asked me out after that,

287
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:10,024
and our first date
was amazing...!

288
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:11,124
Oh... sorry.

289
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:13,691
Listen to me babbling
like a little school girl...

290
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:26,124
Dad's home!

291
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:28,057
Hi, dear.

292
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:30,157
[SELIM]
Hello, Daddy!

293
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:32,191
Well hello there my little one.

294
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:34,224
What are you doing back home?

295
00:17:34,224 --> 00:17:35,957
[BRADLEY] I had some
free time for a change,

296
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:38,324
so I thought I'd
check in on my family.

297
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:40,791
And I also happened to hear

298
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,024
that the Fullmetal
Alchemist and his brother

299
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:44,491
were paying us a visit.

300
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:45,724
Hello, sir.

301
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:47,157
[AL]
Long time no see.

302
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:48,157
Long time?

303
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:50,991
I just saw you boys at
Central Command, right?

304
00:17:57,924 --> 00:18:00,791
[BRADLEY] So, you ran into
these two at the library, Selim?

305
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,224
Yep!

306
00:18:06,857 --> 00:18:09,057
Are you wondering why
he doesn't look like us?

307
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:10,291
N-No sir...

308
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,891
It didn't cross my mind.

309
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,957
Well, it's because we
aren't related by blood.

310
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:18,757
We were unable to have
any children of our own...

311
00:18:18,757 --> 00:18:21,457
So we adopted Selim,
and he's our son now.

312
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,291
I'm proud of my boy.

313
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,357
He's grown into a
fine, devoted son.

314
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:28,191
Would ya cut it
out already, Dad?

315
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,024
You're embarrassing me.

316
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:31,924
[BRADLEY]
But it's the truth!

317
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:40,824
What's wrong, Elric?

318
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:45,157
[AL] Oh... uh, it's just
that we never see you...

319
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,024
except at the command center...

320
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:49,391
So this is kind of, you know...

321
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:52,791
It's a side of you we're not
used to seeing, that's all.

322
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,891
[BRADLEY]
I see. But as you can tell,

323
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:59,457
even a man like me has a family
waiting for him at home...

324
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,357
I'm sure, of course...

325
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,357
it's quite different from yours.

326
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:18,191
Aw, Daddy...
you're leaving already?

327
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:22,057
Yes... You know I have
duties to get back to, Selim.

328
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:29,991
[BRADLEY] Please...
make yourself at home.

329
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:32,391
You're welcome any time,
State Alchemist.

330
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:42,191
Let's go.

331
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,491
Please, come back and
visit us soon, okay?

332
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:57,757
We will. See you later!

333
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:09,024
[AL] It's sad. Neither
Selim nor his mother

334
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:11,857
know what Fuhrer
Bradley really is.

335
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,824
[ED] Come on, let's go!
We're headed north.

336
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:22,357
We'll catch that
obnoxious little brat

337
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:25,891
and make her tell us everything
she knows about alkahestry!

338
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:36,191
We'll be there soon...
Get some sleep.

339
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:58,457
[KIMBLEE] I see... He managed
to escape us again, did he?

340
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,457
This is an accurate map
of the West Area, right?

341
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:06,291
Uh, yes sir.

342
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:11,957
This is the spot where
he was last sighted.

343
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:15,757
Right here... And
West City is there...

344
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:17,157
Scar and Marcoh disappeared

345
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:19,791
somewhere in between
the two places.

346
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,324
Trains slow down
when they turn...

347
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:28,891
but how much speed
do they lose...?

348
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:31,791
Is it possible the two
we're looking for jumped off?

349
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,757
It would have been
very dangerous, sir...

350
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:35,491
But yes, it's possible.

351
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:40,457
You don't say...
All right then...

352
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:44,157
after they jumped off,
which way would they go?

353
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:47,324
North.... Or south?

354
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:43,324
[AL] This is the first time
we've every been so far north.

355
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:45,191
Yeah, it is.

356
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,324
I wonder if we'll see any snow.

357
00:23:47,324 --> 00:23:49,157
That would be something...

358
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:50,791
I might like to see that.

359
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,357
Snow's one thing we
never got much of back home.

360
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:07,124
<i>[NARRATOR] The pursuer...
and the pursued...</i>

361
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:11,291
<i>Madness and hatred colliding
in a bleak world of white...</i>

362
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,024
<i>An unprecedented struggle</i>

363
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:17,024
<i>opening a doorway into
a new, unknown world.</i>

364
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:20,857
<i>Next time, on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood</i>

365
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:22,357
<i>Episode 33...</i>

366
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:26,057
<i>"The Northern Wall of Briggs."</i>

367
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:28,457
<i>Her golden hair
shines like fire...</i>

368
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:31,791
<i>made of ice so cold it burns.</i>
