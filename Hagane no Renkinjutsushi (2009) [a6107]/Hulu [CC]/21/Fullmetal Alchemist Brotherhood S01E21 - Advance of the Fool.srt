1
00:00:01,967 --> 00:00:02,895
You're an idiot!

2
00:00:02,895 --> 00:00:07,023
It's bad enough you believed
her, but then you gave up?

3
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:08,990
Please forgive me, Colonel.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,418
You've gotta stay strong...

5
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:12,551
And don't you ever
give up on living...

6
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:17,418
I need to know you can keep your
cool no matter what happens.

7
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,418
Sir.

8
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:22,385
I'm gonna continue to rely
on you to watch my back.

9
00:00:22,385 --> 00:00:23,618
Don't let me down...

10
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:26,385
[Havoc] Ya oughta think about
takin' your own advice, Colonel.

11
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:28,851
Since You were the one
who abandoned his post.

12
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:30,018
Hey, shut up, Havoc!

13
00:00:30,418 --> 00:00:32,885
[groans]

14
00:00:32,885 --> 00:00:34,385
And what the hell?...

15
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:36,385
Why are we even in
the same room?...

16
00:00:36,385 --> 00:00:39,551
At my rank.. I should have my
own room with a hot nurse.

17
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:41,651
Try to understand, sir...

18
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:43,951
It's easier to guard the two
of you in the same place.

19
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:45,585
Which reminds me...

20
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:48,618
Why haven't they tried
to kill us yet?

21
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:50,951
[Envy] What's wrong with you?!

22
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,851
How could you let that bastard
go after what he did?!...

23
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:55,885
You should've yanked his
spine out of his mouth!

24
00:00:56,985 --> 00:00:59,851
Lust.. he killed Lust.

25
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,918
It's not too late to kill him...
So get to it!

26
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:05,485
We can use Mustang...

27
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:07,618
He's worthless if we
kill him however.

28
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,651
[Envy] Use him?.. Hold on...

29
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:11,951
You mean the portal?

30
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:14,018
[Bradley chuckles] You don't
need to worry about it...

31
00:01:14,018 --> 00:01:15,618
And forget Mustang.

32
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,651
Father wants me to handle him.

33
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,164
[Al] What if I've
started to rot?

34
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:56,397
[Winry] Huh?
[Ed] Huh?

35
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:59,131
I doubt that my body's
getting any nutrients...

36
00:02:59,131 --> 00:03:00,997
Or any sleep either...

37
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:03,164
So even if we get it
back from over there...

38
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,997
[Al] Brother!.. Winry!

39
00:03:06,997 --> 00:03:08,764
[horrified screams]

40
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,831
[gasp] Is he right, Ed?

41
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:12,997
[sigh]

42
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:14,964
Now this is just a hypothesis...

43
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:16,864
But I was thinking about
the transmutation

44
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,864
and trying to retrace
our processs...

45
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,864
You remember how we mixed
our blood to create

46
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:22,997
a blueprint for Mom's soul?

47
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:24,197
[Al] Yeah.

48
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:26,931
[Ed] Well.. Right after that we
passed through the portal...

49
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:29,231
Where we were both deconstructed.

50
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:31,997
It's a slim chance...

51
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:34,131
but I think it's possible our
spirits might have gotten

52
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,631
tangled up in the process.

53
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:38,297
[Al] What are you saying?

54
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:40,731
I'm trying to explain
that our bodies might

55
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:42,731
be connected somehow
even though I'm here

56
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,397
and your body's over there.

57
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:50,264
See.. that might actually
explain why I'm so sho...

58
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,997
sho...

59
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:53,131
Short.

60
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:54,431
He admitted it!

61
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:56,397
[Al] He's starting to face
reality!

62
00:03:56,397 --> 00:04:00,097
So.. You think you've been
supplying all the nutrients

63
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:01,397
for Al's body too?

64
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:03,931
That seems a little
far-fetched.

65
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,964
Well what's your explanation?

66
00:04:05,964 --> 00:04:08,731
You don't grow because you
refuse to drink your milk.

67
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,697
Don't start with that again!

68
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:11,964
[Winry] Well it's true.

69
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:13,964
[Al] It seems like Brother
is always sleeping...

70
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:16,964
I wonder if his body could be
resting for mine as well?

71
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:19,231
[Winry] Not until you start
drinking it! You have to!

72
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:20,731
[Ed] It's not gonna happen!...
[Winry] Drink it, Ed!

73
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:22,231
[Ed] No!
[Winry] Fine, stay a runt!

74
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:23,064
[Ed] I'm not a runt!

75
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:24,397
[Al giggling] I hope so, at least.

76
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,264
[Ed] Never!

77
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,264
[Winry] I'll make you!
[Ed] Just try!

78
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:29,697
[birds chirping]

79
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:30,564
[Fuery] Are you here to
visit the Colonel?

80
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:33,231
[Al] Mr. Havoc is
recovering, too...

81
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,197
We figured we should
pay our respects.

82
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,931
I definitely owe it
to the Colonel...

83
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:39,097
He saved me right at
the last second.

84
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,897
Are you also dropping
by for a visit?

85
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:45,931
And bringing a little present.

86
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:49,764
[Hawkeye] I counted the number
of steps it took to get

87
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:51,931
to the basement under
the third laboratory...

88
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:54,264
And I was able to calculate
the approximate location

89
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:56,331
of that doorway.

90
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:58,864
It's not exact since
the hallway curved...

91
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:00,864
but I was able to
deduce a radius

92
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:02,897
with the lab at the center.

93
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:08,897
That's Central Command.. But
this is even more alarming.

94
00:05:08,897 --> 00:05:10,897
[Al] It's the presidential estate...

95
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:13,831
Right above where we
found the Homunculi.

96
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,897
[Roy] Which means that there's
a very real possibility

97
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:19,764
the Fuhrer is connected
to them.

98
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:21,397
[Al] But that doesn't
make sense...

99
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:22,897
Why did he kill Greed
and his group

100
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:25,164
if he's connected to them?

101
00:05:25,164 --> 00:05:27,297
It's strange he killed
them anyway...

102
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:30,764
Why would he slaughter them
before interrogating them?

103
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,764
It's strange alright...
Damn inscrutable.

104
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:36,864
One thing's for sure,

105
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:39,397
the enemy's infiltrated
high up the command...

106
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:42,864
So extreme caution is
necessary at all times.

107
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,164
And Fullmetal?...
Watch yourself.

108
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:52,031
[Roy] The Fuhrer working
with the Homunculi.

109
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:56,897
This could be bigger than
I ever dreamed.

110
00:05:57,897 --> 00:05:59,864
I'm starting to worry
that it's too big.

111
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:02,731
[Roy] All the more reason
to pursue it.

112
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:05,797
So.. I hope you're ready to work
yourselves ragged.

113
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:08,131
Uhhhh, yeah, about
that, Colonel?...

114
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:10,331
I think you're gonna haveta'
count me out.

115
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:13,131
[sighs]

116
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:16,797
Your work requires legs...
and I can't feel mine.

117
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:18,864
[shocked breath]

118
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:22,031
[Havoc] I hate to say
it.. but I'm retired.

119
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,397
Hello.

120
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:33,864
Hey.. What brings you down here?

121
00:06:33,864 --> 00:06:35,197
Back problems...

122
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:37,731
My spine can't stand all
the standing that comes

123
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,764
with being coroner.

124
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,864
I got a sinking feeling
when I heard

125
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:46,831
you were the person that
scorched that thing...

126
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:48,831
Are you plotting something?

127
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,864
You suspect a plot but you
still ID'ed the "thing" as

128
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:55,097
Maria Ross. Three cheers for
old war buddies, huh?

129
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:59,831
Old war buddies my butt...
More like accomplices.

130
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:02,831
You'd incinerate 'em and
I'd dissect what's left...

131
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:05,297
We treated them like rats
and Ishval was the lab.

132
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,097
I know you like to
play with fire,

133
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:15,731
but someone'll get burnt if
you push this too far.

134
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:17,764
You should've warned me earlier.

135
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:21,831
Did somebody get injured?

136
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:25,097
One of my men.

137
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,364
He was paralyzed. From
the waist down.

138
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:38,831
Damn. They only let me smoke
one of these a day,

139
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,864
and I go and waste it.

140
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,664
Jeez.. Ya know, I thought I'd
retire because of a woman,

141
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,697
but not like this.

142
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,264
So what happens next?

143
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:56,164
My family owns a grocery store...
And I can at least take calls.

144
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:58,197
Isn't automail an option?

145
00:07:58,797 --> 00:07:59,864
[Havoc sighs]

146
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:03,264
The nerves in my lower spine
are completely severed

147
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:05,764
and they can't make
those out of steel.

148
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:06,764
[Breda] Tsk.

149
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:08,797
The retired life doesn't
suit you.

150
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:15,297
[Breda] Colonel.

151
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:16,797
Hmm.

152
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,764
There's still hope for Havoc.

153
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,797
Fullmetal passed this onto me,

154
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:24,731
[Roy] Doctor Marcoh, huh?...

155
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:26,997
A medical alchemist
in possession of a...

156
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:29,697
Philosopher's Stone?

157
00:08:29,697 --> 00:08:31,731
Well, sir?.. Should I find him?

158
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:34,164
Permission granted.

159
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:36,197
Get going.

160
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:39,997
[footsteps]

161
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,731
[Brosh] Oh!.. Major!

162
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:42,564
Hmm.

163
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,731
I didn't expect you
back so soon.

164
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:46,731
How did you enjoy your
vacation to the east?

165
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:48,031
[grunt]

166
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:51,031
Loose lips sink ships, Major.

167
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:55,331
The scenery was luminous
and the women desirable.

168
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:56,464
[uncomfortable laugh]

169
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:59,164
[Brosh] Oh, before I forget...
This just arrived from

170
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,197
the Provost Marshal's office.

171
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:04,297
[Brosh] It's an urgent bulletin
for all State Alchemists.

172
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:07,097
Good heavens!

173
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:10,297
[dogs barking]

174
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:11,964
[Al] How'd it go?

175
00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:14,397
Easy.. I told them I was
a State Alchemist

176
00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:17,164
and they let me right in with
no questions asked.

177
00:09:17,164 --> 00:09:18,731
[Al] Did you find the basement?

178
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:19,997
There wasn't one.

179
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:21,264
Uh?!

180
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,797
But I did find a trace of
some hasty alchemy.

181
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:27,164
It was stupid of us to think
that they wouldn't

182
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:29,197
seal up the entrance.

183
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:32,231
[Al] I guess so.. Where else
are we gonna find

184
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:34,264
a Homunculus if we can't
get down there?

185
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:38,731
I'm not sure.. Remember
how they told me

186
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:41,331
I was their sacrifice and
they needed me alive?

187
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,997
[Al] They told me
the same thing.

188
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:45,997
Lust told me that when she found
out I opened the portal.

189
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:47,964
Well there's one piece
of the puzzle...

190
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:50,797
They're looking for alchemists
that managed to open the portal

191
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:53,131
and make it back out alive.

192
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:56,231
But the real question is why
they wanna sacrifice us...

193
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:58,264
So.. We'll haveta beat
an answer out of 'em.

194
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:00,564
[Brosh] Edward, wait!

195
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:02,431
What the?.. Is that
Sergeant Brosh?

196
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:04,131
I'm glad I found you.

197
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:05,931
Yeah, why don't you tell
me what's wrong?

198
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:08,664
You should get back to
your hotel right now.

199
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:10,697
I can escort you if
you want me to.

200
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:14,731
[Douglas] Attention all
military personnel...

201
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:17,897
It has been verified that Scar
has returned to Central...

202
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:20,164
Three casualties have
been reported.

203
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:23,164
All confirmed as State Alchemists.

204
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,664
According to eyewitness reports,
he is described as an Ishvalan

205
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:29,197
with an X-shaped scar
on his forehead.

206
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:30,831
Other identifiable markings

207
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,864
include a tattoo on
his right arm.

208
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:38,397
A tattoo.. It was him.

<i>[Narrator]

211
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:50,551
[Al] So you're saying that
Scar killed Winry's parents?

212
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:53,385
I don't know for certain but
that's the way it looks.

213
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:55,685
Poor Winry.. Brother...

214
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:57,751
You weren't planning on
telling her, were you?

215
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,651
Of course not, Al.

216
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:03,618
I couldn't stand to be the one
to make her cry again.

217
00:11:03,618 --> 00:11:05,651
[Al] Neither could I.

218
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:10,151
It's the last thing I wanna do,
but we have to confront Scar.

219
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:11,451
To find out if he did it?

220
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:15,351
Well that is one reason.. But
there's another.

221
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:17,651
We're gonna lure out
the Homunculi.

222
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:18,685
Uh!

223
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:22,051
They need us alive for their
sacrifice, don't they?

224
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:24,051
So I doubt they're willing
to just stand by

225
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,718
while Scar kills us.

226
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,651
Ya think so? Sounds like a
pretty big gamble to me.

227
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:32,251
Well it's much better
than doing nothing!

228
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:33,385
Oh really?

229
00:11:33,385 --> 00:11:36,451
Because Scar literally tore
us apart the last time.

230
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:41,318
Well..we've..gotten stronger, in
these, past few months.

231
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:44,118
What happens if the Homunculi
do show up?...

232
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:45,518
How are you gonna catch one?...

233
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:48,518
They're super strong and they
pretty much can't die!

234
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:51,251
Can't die?!.. Was
that hyperbole?

235
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:54,651
Or are they actually immortal?

236
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:56,685
[Al] Why don't we lock
the windows?

237
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,451
[Ling] Count us in.. We'd
love to help you guys!

238
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:01,785
Why's that?

239
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:04,051
I can't say I care about
the military stuff...

240
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,785
But it sounds like
these Homunculi

241
00:12:05,785 --> 00:12:08,018
are just what we've
been looking for.

242
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:12,718
[Ling] What's wrong? You
look kinda skeptical.

243
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:17,151
Don't get me wrong, I am
grateful for the help you've
already given.. but this-

244
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:19,185
You've got better odds
with more help.

245
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:24,118
I'm serious about this.. This
could be what rescues my clan.

246
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:35,251
Alright then.. Just remember...
We're in this together.

247
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:39,518
I promise not to run off with
them.. I owe you that much.

248
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:41,285
What for?

249
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:46,285
Is this for room service?

to wake up tomorrow?!

Oh! Right, I forgot!...

You're catching the early
train to Rush Val-

Uhh.

259
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:04,685
Y'know what?.. You
should cancel that...

260
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:06,151
Why don't you stick
around and relax?

261
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:07,451
Huh?!

262
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:10,051
I mean it's just that...
Y'know.. Well...

263
00:13:10,051 --> 00:13:13,518
There's.. always the chance
my arm could get broken...

264
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,551
or even.. destroyed.

265
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:17,651
Are you planning on
destroying it?!

anything too dangerous.

back to base.

excuse me.

have a chance.. I'm useless.

at me like that.

to worry about me!...
