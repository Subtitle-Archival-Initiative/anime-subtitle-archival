Alchemy...</i>

4
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:08,680

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,613

7
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,880

<i>In accordance with this law,</i>

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,746
<i>there is a taboo

12
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:26,246
<i>Human transmutation

13
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:28,946

00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:30,597
<i>into the secrets of

26
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:34,164
Augghh!!!

27
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:38,197
[ED] Dr. Marcoh's research...!
It's all gone!

28
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:40,631
[LUST]
In the end,

29
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:42,731
burning the entire
place down was easier.

30
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:45,064
[GLUTTONY] Oh, is that what
you were doing in Central?

31
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,231
[LUST]
Yes...

32
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:49,531
The Fullmetal boy found out
about Marcoh's research...

33
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:51,664
Something had to
be done about it.

34
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,897
[LUST] With that
issue taken care of,

35
00:02:54,897 --> 00:02:56,564
I thought I would
come to see how things

36
00:02:56,564 --> 00:03:00,864
are progressing in
East City... Is he here?

37
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:01,797
[LUST]
Gluttony?

38
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:04,664
[GLUTTONY] I smell 'im...
I can smell him!

39
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:06,564
[GLUTTONY]
The scar-faced Ishvalan.

40
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:10,597
He's close. I can taste
his stink--like blood!

41
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:12,531
[GLUTTONY] I still
get to eat him, right?

42
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:14,931
[LUST] Oh yes, down to
the last strand of hair.

43
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:51,731
[explosion]

44
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:55,064
[HAWKEYE]
Scar hasn't been sighted...

45
00:03:55,064 --> 00:03:58,597
Not once since that incident
with the Elric brothers.

46
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:00,931
[HAVOC] Maybe he's not
even in East City anymore.

47
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:02,631
[ROY] I hope you're
wrong about that.

48
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:03,697
[HAVOC] Huh?

49
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:05,231
[ROY] This case
has obviously gotten

50
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:07,164
to be too much for
Central to handle...

51
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,931
If I can close it quickly
enough, I'll be golden.

52
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:13,764
[ROY] I've got a
ladder to climb,

53
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:15,497
and this is how it's done...

54
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:17,797
I need every mark in my
favor that I can get...

55
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:21,064
At least until I've assumed
the office of Fuhrer, that is.

56
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:22,464
[HAWKEYE] You may
not want to display

57
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:24,831
your ambitions
quite so nakedly, Sir.

58
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:26,831
[ROY]
Yeah...

59
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,097
I'll be sure to remember
that in the future.

60
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:30,564
[SOLDIER 1]
Reporting in, sir!

61
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:31,531
[SOLDIER 1]
We've just received word

62
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:34,131
of an explosion
occurring on the Marl River.

63
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:35,764
[ROY]
What?

64
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:40,031
[MP A]
Was it a gas explosion?

65
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,597
[MP B]
With everything else

66
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:43,664
that's been going on
around here, who knows?

67
00:04:48,197 --> 00:04:49,564
[HAWKEYE]
There's no mistaking it.

68
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:51,864
This was definitely
Scar's jacket.

69
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:53,664
[ROY] Have you
found the body?

70
00:04:53,664 --> 00:04:55,597
[HAVOC] Not yet,
but we're still searching.

71
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:57,497
[HAWKEYE] Either way,
he can't be in good shape

72
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,831
after losing
this much blood.

73
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,064
[ROY] Yeah... But we
do this by the book.

74
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:03,231
We need to find hard
proof that he's dead...

75
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:04,497
All right,
Lieutenant Havoc.

76
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:05,497
[HAVOC]
Yes, Sir?

77
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:06,764
[ROY] You and your men
will work day and night

78
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,131
to clear out
this debris...

79
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:09,697
I want his body found...

80
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:11,897
Don't take so much as a
coffee break until that's done,

81
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:13,031
do you understand?

82
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:13,831
[HAVOC]
Come on Colonel,

83
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,531
can't you cut
us some slack...?

84
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,597
At this rate, you're
gonna work us all to death.

85
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:18,731
[ROY]
Shut up!

86
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:20,931
[ROY] I don't get to relax
until I've seen his body.

87
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:23,897
That means you
don't get to either.

88
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:25,664
[HAVOC] I guess
we'll get to work then.

89
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:28,597
[LUST]
Looks like he got away.

90
00:05:28,597 --> 00:05:30,031
[GLUTTONY]
I didn't get my snack.

91
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:31,064
[LUST]
Yes, I know...

92
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,964
Maybe next time... Though...

93
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:35,631
I think we can safely assume

94
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:38,497
that Scar will be out
of the game for awhile.

95
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,864
[LUST] I suppose I'll be
heading back to Central again...

96
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,197
I need to report to Father

97
00:05:42,197 --> 00:05:44,497
about everything
that's happened here.

98
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:49,631

left here but ashes.

To what do we
owe this pleasure?

104
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:00,664
[ROSS]
You have been ordered

105

106
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:03,797

00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:09,031
[ARMSTRONG]
Very well. He's yours.

109
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:09,731
[ED]
What is this?

110
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:11,031
Just when I think I'm home free,

111
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:12,897
they saddle me
with more bodyguards?

112
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:14,564
This is getting old!

113
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:17,997
[ROSS]
All might not be lost...

114
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:18,897
There's a woman who
was well acquainted

00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:22,164

116
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:22,964

Unfortunately...

117
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:25,497
she wasn't working

Thank you! I'm so sorry!

Yes.

Oh, the library...!

148
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,896
The word itself
is so beautiful...!

149
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,796
[SHESKA] I've loved books
my whole entire life...

150
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:49,129
ever since I first
learned to read as a girl...

151
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:51,496
that job... was heaven!

152
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:53,529
[SHESKA]
But I forgot

153
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:54,696
that I was supposed
to be working,

154
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,529
and all I ever did was read...

155
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:58,096
So they fired me.

156
00:07:58,096 --> 00:07:59,762
[SHESKA]
If I don't find another job,

157
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,562

00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:28,629
Oh! Yes, of course.
I remember now!

172
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:29,496
[ED]
Really?

173
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:31,562
[SHESKA] Oh yes,
I'm absolutely positive.

174
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:33,062
There were some
handwritten notes

175
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,629
stuffed into a bookcase
where they didn't belong.

176
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:38,529
[ED] The notes really
were there after all!

177
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:39,529
[ED] Which means
they burned up

178
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:41,796
along with everything
else in the library...

179
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:42,662
[SHESKA] Did you
want to read them?

180
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,096
Is that why you're asking?

181
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:45,962
[ED] Yeah, but
it's too late now.

182
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:47,229
They're nothing but ashes.

183
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:48,729
[AL]
Sorry to bother you.

184
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,696
[SHESKA] I remember
everything that was in them.

185
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,062
Would that help at all?

186
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:54,729
[ED and AL]
Huh?!

187
00:08:54,729 --> 00:08:55,962
[SHESKA]
It's just how I am...

188
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:59,762
I'm able to remember the content
of any book I've ever read.

189
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:00,629
[SHESKA]
It'll take awhile,

190
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:02,196
but I could write
them out for you.

191
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,629
[ED]
Thank you bookworm...!

192
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:04,962
You're my hero!

193
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,896
[SHESKA]
You're... welcome?

194
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:09,896
[SHESKA]
Here you are!

195
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:13,062
Complete copies of
all Tim Marcoh's notes!

196
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,596
[SHESKA] Sorry, I know five
days is a long time to wait,

197
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,629
but there was quite
a lot to write down.

198
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:18,629
[AL]
Unbelievable!

199
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:21,096
There are some amazing
people in this world!

200
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:23,729
[ED] These are really
Dr. Marcoh's research notes?

201
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,462
[SHESKA]
They sure are.

202
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:25,896
Come and take
a look at them.

203
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:27,562

two onions, salt...

207
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:35,762
[ROSS] Oh great.
Does this mean we came

208
00:09:35,762 --> 00:09:36,762
all this way for a cook book?

209
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:38,229
[BROSH] Miss, which part
of this made you think

210
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:39,696
it was an
important document?

211
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:41,596
[SHESKA] Is it not what
you're looking for...?

212
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:44,262
All I did was copy
down what I remember.

213
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:47,229
[BROSH] Wonderful--so this
was just a wild goose chase?

214
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:49,162
[ED] Sheska...
are you absolutely sure

215
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:52,296
this is a flawless
reproduction of the notes?

216
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:53,029
[SHESKA]
Oh yes.

217
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:55,096
I'm one hundred
percent certain!

218
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,762

Then thank you very much...

00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,596
You're incredible!

220
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:01,062
[ED] All right. Let's get
these back to the library.

221
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:05,129
[AL] They should have
related materials there.

222
00:10:06,896 --> 00:10:10,662
[ED] Oh... I almost
forgot Sheska's fee.

223
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:11,862
[ED]
Lieutenant... Here...

224
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,129
This is my
registration number

225
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,629
and the pocket watch for ID.

226
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:16,562
[ED]
Withdraw that amount

227
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:17,829
from my annual research grants

228
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:20,696
and make sure
Sheska gets it, okay?

229
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:22,829
[ROSS] Right... I'll get
on that right away, sir.

230
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:24,562
I assume that I can
just take this note down

231
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:25,829
to the State Alchemist office?

232
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:27,229

That should work.

233
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:29,829
[ED] Well... Sheska,
you're a life saver!

234
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:30,929
Bye!

235
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:35,929
[ROSS] From his
research grants, huh?

236
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:36,996
[Shocked cries]

237
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:39,529
[SHESKA] Did he miss a
decimal point somewhere?!

238
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:40,262
Wow!

239
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:41,662
[ROSS] How does
a boy like that

240
00:10:41,662 --> 00:10:43,162
have this kind of
money to throw around?

241
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:47,994
[BROSH]
I-I don't understand...

242
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:48,960
These are cookbooks.

243
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,160
What could they possibly
have to do with alchemy?

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,694
[ED] Alchemy's a
powerful art...

00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,994
It can be incredibly
dangerous if misused...

246
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:57,460
In order to
prevent that...

247
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,194
[ED] Alchemic research

advanced alchemical notes...

Only the alchemist who
originally wrote them

252
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,594
can understand.

253
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,194
[BROSH] If they're
so heavily encrypted,

be able to decipher them?

255

[ED] It's not
going to be easy...

We'll have to use all

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
[BROSH] Wow, sir...

258
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,494
That sounds really complicated.

00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:23,760
[ED] Al, there's a section
in here on green tea!

260
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,994

Green tea?

261
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:26,127
Are you thinking what I am?

262
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:26,994

Uh-huh...

263
00:11:26,994 --> 00:11:27,960
t might be a reference

264

to the Green Lion of
metallurgic alchemy...

265
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:32,627
Do we have copies
available of Flamel's Codex

the Philosopher's Stone?

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,527

Of course.

268
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:39,094
[ED] Alright...
take a look at this here...

269
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:40,460
[ED]
And here too, you see?

270
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,527
[AL]
Yeah, you're right...

271
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:42,994
And maybe here, too.

272
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,460
[ED] Great... We've got
a place to start...

273
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,994

00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:49,094

00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:01,214
[ED]
Why does this encryption

277
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:04,247
have to be so damn
hard to figure out?

278
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:06,047
[AL] Brother...
Maybe we should ask

279
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,247
Dr. Marcoh about this directly.

280
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:09,180
[ED] No way...!

281
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,980
That'd be admitting defeat!

282
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,847
[AL] So this is
a contest now?

283
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,647
[SHESKA]
Excuse me...

284
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:15,947

Sheska!

285
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,214
[SHESKA] Thanks to
the money you gave me,

286
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:21,880
Edward, I was able
to move my mother

287
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,214

I really appreciate it.

288
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:27,180
[ED] Aw, it was no
big deal, really.

289
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,880
[SHESKA] Have you had any
luck deciphering it so far?

290
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:34,047
[AL] Have you found
another job yet?

291
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:39,647
[SHESKA] Anyway... you
two made me feel better.

292
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:41,214
It was nice to know
that even a pathetic mess

293
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:43,080

out sometimes.

294
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,714
[SHESKA] So thanks
for that as well.

295
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:46,380
[AL] You're not
a pathetic mess.

296
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:48,914
[AL] I think that
the kind of dedication

297
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:51,947
you show to reading is a
talent all on its own...

298
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:54,247
And besides that, your
memory is incredible...

299
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:57,647
You should have
more faith in yourself.

300
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,047
[SHESKA]
Thank you, Al.

00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,047
I told you to
give me a shout

307
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:12,147
the next time you
made it to Central.

308
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:15,014

urgent came up, sorry.

It's just as well.

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,080

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,014
[ROSS] Just how high
up are these boys?

314
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,947
[HUGHES] We've had a lot of
cases to deal with lately...

unpleasant memories, huh?

00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:34,614
[HUGHES]
Anyway...

00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,147
[HUGHES] As if things weren't
bad enough for us already...

321

a problem, huh?

00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:42,247
[HUGHES]
A big one...

325
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:43,680
All our case
records were stored

remember them all.

513
00:20:58,127 --> 00:20:59,794
[ED]
Well, in that case...

514
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:01,827
[AL]
And... Up!

515
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:21,161
[ED] They're not taking
any chances, are they?

516
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:28,794
[ED]
Al... you need to wait here.

517
00:21:28,794 --> 00:21:30,561
[AL]
You're fine on your own?

518
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:32,261
[ED] Whether I'm
fine on my own

519
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:33,127
or not isn't the issue.

520
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:36,527
You're too big to
get through here.

521
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:39,194
[AL] It's not like
I asked to get this big.

522
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:44,361
[48]
Sixty-six?

523
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:46,294
[66]
What is it, Forty-eight?

524
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:48,294
[48] It looks as
if we've got guests.

525
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:52,427
[66] Some daredevil idiots
came to visit, did they?

526
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:55,227
[ED]
Damn...

527
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:57,294
It's even tighter in
here than I thought.

528
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:58,961
[ED] I couldn't
get through this far

529
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:00,894
if I was regular sized...

530
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:04,261
Lucky I've got a small body.

531
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:05,261
[ED]
Oh no!!

532
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:08,761
I just called myself a
tiny little pipsqueak!

533
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:15,127
[ED]
There are lights on.

534
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:16,327
[ED]
"Not currently in use."

535
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:18,161
Who are they
trying to fool?

536
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:21,394
[ED]
This is it all right.

537
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:23,927
[AL] Ed's taking
a long time.
