to shut up and he

349
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:30,356
spoils his daughter rotten.

350
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:32,789
[AL] He did come by
your hospital room

351
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:34,589
a lot to talk to you.

352
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:36,423
Every damn day.

353
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:40,656
He always made a point
to come and keep me company...

354
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:41,823
and it didn't matter when...

355
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:43,589
He'd even blow off work.

356
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:44,689
[AL] We should figure
out some way

357
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:46,456
to thank him
next time we're there.

358
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:48,223

Yeah. We should.

00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:20,823
Mommy?

361
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:24,523
Why are they putting
all that dirt on Daddy?

362
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:25,956
They're burying him, dear.

363
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:27,323
But if Daddy gets buried,

364
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:30,523
then he won't be
able to do all his work.

00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,989
No, stop it...!

00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:42,656
Stop putting

[ROY] Promoted
to Brigadier General...

371
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:52,956
Just for dying
in the line of duty.

372
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:55,256
You were supposed to be
helping me work my way

373

up through the ranks...

374
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,423
You got it all backwards.

You damn, crazy fool...

Colonel?

we really are horrible
creatures... aren't we?

379
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:13,623
[ROY] There's a side of me
that's desperately trying

380
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:17,989
to crack the theories of
human transmutation right now...

381
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:20,989
[ROY] I think I understand
what drove those boys

382
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:25,223
when they tried to...
bring back their mother.

383
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:30,323
Are you alright, Colonel?

384
00:18:30,323 --> 00:18:32,223
Yeah, I'm fine.

385
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:33,923
Except...

386
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:36,623
It's a terrible day for rain.

387
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:37,923
What do you mean...?

388
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:39,823
It's not raining.

389
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,356
Yes... It is.

390
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:48,923
[HAWKEYE]
Oh, so it is...

391
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:50,523
Why don't we head back...?

392
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:52,856
It's getting chilly out here.

393
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,736
He said he'd be in
the archive room,

394
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,369
and then he just left.

395
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:02,536
But he had this look...

396
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:04,869
Like he realized
something terrible.

397
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:08,602
[ROY] So he must've
been attacked in here.

398
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:10,369
[FOCKER]
Looks like it.

399
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:11,802
[FOCKER]
He left a trail of blood...

400
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,502
It runs all the way
down the hall.

401
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:16,936
Apparently, he was heading
straight to the phone room.

402
00:19:18,336 --> 00:19:19,536
[RECEPTIONIST]
He was hurt...

403
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:21,936
And he said that he
needed to call someone.

404
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:22,902
But then...

405
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:24,669
He just walked
out instead...

406
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:26,902
He didn't even
dial a number.

407
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,569
[ROY THINKS] He obviously picked
up on something big...

408
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,902
He was gonna
call from the office...

409
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:35,702
but something occurred to

410
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:38,736
him and he
used an outside line.

411
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:40,736
[ROY THINKS] The code that
he gave the operator is only

412
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:44,836
supposed to be used
for military emergencies.

413
00:19:44,836 --> 00:19:46,902
[ROY THINKS]
So what was it...?

414
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:49,902
What the hell was
he trying to tell me?

415
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,636
[HAWKEYE]
Colonel.

416
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:55,669
I found Major Armstrong,
as you asked me to.

417
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:01,302
[ARMSTRONG] We have a strong
lead on some potential suspects

418
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:03,502
in the murder of
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes.

419
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,469
[ROY] Then why aren't you
hunting them down right now?

420
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,836
We're confident that we
know who committed the crime,

421
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:11,336
but we're unsure
of their identities.

422
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:14,769
That doesn't make sense,
Major. Clarify for me.

423
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:15,569
I'm afraid I cannot.

424
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:17,736
I'm telling you to
explain as your

425
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:18,969
commanding officer...

426
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,602
You're disobeying
a direct order, Major.

427
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:23,436
I cannot tell you.

428
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:29,336
Fair enough...

429
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:31,336
I apologize
for my tone...

430
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:32,502
You're dismissed.

431
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:33,469
Sir.

432
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,869
[ARMSTRONG] Actually,
sir, there is another

433
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,036
matter I've
neglected to mention.

434
00:20:40,036 --> 00:20:42,336
The Elric brothers
were recently here.

435
00:20:42,336 --> 00:20:45,502
They only departed
a couple of days ago.

436
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,302
They were here in Central?

437
00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:50,236
[ARMSTRONG] Yes sir...
For a number of days.

438
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:52,602
And did they manage
to find whatever

439
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:54,369
they were looking for?

440
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:55,736
No sir... That would be rather

441
00:20:55,736 --> 00:20:58,736
difficult as they
are pursuing a legend.

442
00:20:58,736 --> 00:20:59,836
Is that so...?

443
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:02,336
Well thanks for your help.

444
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:04,669
So, I guess he wasn't

445
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:06,536
as helpful to us as
we had hoped.

446
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:08,369
But not a waste
of our time...

447
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:10,902
He was more helpful
than he meant to be.

448
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,669
He said that they
had a strong lead,

449
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:14,936
singular tense,
on a few suspects...

450
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:16,802
Multiple suspects...

451
00:21:16,802 --> 00:21:17,936
Which leads me to believe

452
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:21,436
they suspect
a group is responsible.

453
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:23,402
And his obstinate
refusal to talk,

454
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:26,736
even though I ordered
him to... can only mean...

455
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:29,002
There's gotta be an officer
above me that's ordered

456
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:30,902
him to keep quiet...

457
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:34,002
Most likely someone
of senior ranking.

458
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,136
The last clue...

459
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:37,802
was that he happened to
mention the Elric brothers...

460
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:41,836
They were researching...
the Philosopher's Stone.

461
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:42,736
[HAWKEYE]
I hate to say it,

462
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,336
but it sounds like
there might be some

463
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,936
kind of conspiracy
going on here...

464
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:49,402
But how does
it all tie together?

465
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:51,536
[ROY] That's
the big question.

466
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:54,602
But Hughes... I'd say he
deserves an answer...

467
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:56,302
Once I'm transferred
to Central...

468
00:21:56,302 --> 00:21:59,269
I'm gonna start shaking
things up until I find one.

469
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:00,169
Doesn't sound
like you to

470
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:02,369
mix your public and
personal concerns.

471
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:04,369
There's no difference
between the two...

472
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:06,669
I will become the
Fuhrer of this country...

473
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:08,902
And I will take
vengeance for Hughes...

474
00:22:08,902 --> 00:22:11,869
I'll do these things because
I have to do them.

475
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:13,836
I'm going after
the senior staff...

476
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,502
Are you with me, Lieutenant?

477
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,636
Do you even have to ask?
