and it's okay.

357
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:40,165
But that man...

358
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,299
You said he's the one who
killed my mom and dad.

359
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:47,499
He tried to kill you and Al
too, Ed. But I couldn't...

360
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:50,565
Why not?!

361
00:21:50,565 --> 00:21:52,199
[Ed] Remember In Rush Valley...

362
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:56,999
you delivered that baby...
you saved two lives.

363
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:01,465
And you gave me an
arm.. and a leg...

364
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:04,865
to replace the ones I'd lost.

365
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:10,265
It's your hands... They
weren't meant to kill.

366
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:12,565
They're meant to give life.

367
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:18,065
That's why.

368
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,965
[crying]

369
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:07,499
[Narrator] What happens when
someone must give something

370
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:09,832
up in order to protect it?

371
00:24:09,832 --> 00:24:12,032
Will his resolve falter?...

372
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,332
Will he crumble beneath
the weight of sacrifice?

373
00:24:15,332 --> 00:24:17,599
Or will his heart
remain strong...

374
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,065
ready to do whatever
is necessary.

375
00:24:21,065 --> 00:24:24,599
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.

376
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,599
Episode 23...Girl on
the Battlefield.

377
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,465
You must not show any
tears of sorrow...

378
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:33,499
That is part the promise.
