the fundamentals of alchemy?

00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:54,839
[MASTER HAWKEYE]
Of course you have...

8
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:57,672
And I regret even
teaching you that much...

you plan on using it for.

[MASTER HAWKEYE COUGHS]

11
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:06,872
But... alchemy should be used
for the people... Shouldn't it?

12
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:10,706
Master...
Our country is constantly

13
00:02:10,706 --> 00:02:12,706
under threat from all sides...

14
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:15,639

alchemists... It's a matter of

15
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,772
defending our homes.
If we don't help them--

16
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:20,806
[MASTER HAWKEYE] I'm tired of
hearing that vile rhetoric.

17
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:30,406
I can't stand to see you like
this. There's no reason for a

18
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:34,072
man of your stature to suffer
in this kind of squalor...

19
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,839
If you would simply
join the military,

20
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,906
you could get grants for
your research, you could--

21
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:39,172

already completed.

00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:45,351
I can think about
tomorrow again...

172
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:50,017
Even if this damn battlefield
might not let me see it.

173
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:53,251
[ROY] I can't picture any
way out of this war...

174
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:56,484
No matter how much military
force we throw at it...

175
00:11:56,484 --> 00:12:00,184
The desert seems to
just suck it up like water.

176
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:04,117
[ROY CONTINUES] All of this
destruction... for what purpose?

177
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:06,084
All that's left is sand.

178
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:08,451
True. It seems a
little excessive

179
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:10,484
to suppress an uprising.

180
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:18,517
Hello, Major Mustang...
Long time no see.

181
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:21,351
Do you still remember me?

182
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:24,317
[ROY THINKS]
Damn this war... Even her...

183
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:27,017
She has the
eyes of a killer, too...

[NARRATOR]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

186
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:43,502
[HAWKEYE] Maybe you can
answer this, Major.

187
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:45,802
Why are we being
ordered to kill citizens...?

188
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:48,802
When we should be
the ones protecting them?

189
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,802
I thought alchemy was meant
to be used to help people...

190
00:12:51,802 --> 00:12:55,635
So why is it being used
to kill them instead?

191
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:57,569
[KIMBLEE] Because that's
the job we State Alchemists

192
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,669
have been given to do.

193
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:01,369
You ask why we're here killing

194
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:03,969
these people instead of
protecting them...?

195
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:07,802
Because this is a war
and that's what soldiers do.

196
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,935
Isn't that right?

197
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:13,535
[ROY] You think this is our
job...? To cause tragedy?

198
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:15,335
[KIMBLEE]
Well that's how it seems...

199
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:17,935
But let's see. Tell me, miss...

200
00:13:17,935 --> 00:13:20,569
You're not very happy
to be here, are you...?

201
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:23,635
Well, you don't appear to be.

202
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,535
[KIMBLEE CONTINUES]
But can you honestly tell me...

203
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:28,635
In that split second when
you take down an enemy...

204
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:31,369
You don't allow yourself
to feel the slightest tinge

205
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:34,669
of satisfaction and pride
in your skills?

206
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,535
Well Miss Marksmen?

207
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:38,435
[ROY]
That's enough, Kimblee!

208
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:39,802
I'll tell you what I don't get.

209
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:42,469
Did you people expect
something different...?

210
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:46,835
You act like you're surprised...
Like you didn't choose this.

211
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:48,869
[KIMBLEE]
Did you put on that uniform

212
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,269
thinking you wouldn't
be asked to kill?

213
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,202
The one thing worse than death
is to avert your eyes from it.

214
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,302
Look straight at
the people you kill...

215
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:01,269
Don't take your eyes
off them for a second.

216
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:03,335
[KIMBLEE CONTINUES]
And don't ever forget them.

217
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:06,669
Because I promise
that they won't forget you.

218
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:11,302
[KIMBLEE] Oh. Too bad...
There's the bell.

219
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:14,302
Time for me to get back to work.

220
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:17,669
I've gotta head out, too...
See ya later, Roy.

221
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:21,469
Hughes... Can you tell
me why you fight?

222
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:26,702
[HUGHES] It's simple...
I don't want to die...

223
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:28,902
That's the only reason.

224
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,569
[HUGHES CONTINUES]
The reasons are always simple.

[MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS]

226
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:40,669
[ROY THINKS]
If that's so...

227
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:43,535
What the hell is
the reason for this war?

228
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:46,569
[MARCOH]
The reason? There is one...

229
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,569
But it's worse
than you can imagine.

230
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:50,602
[SHOTS RING OUT]
[PEOPLE REACT TO BEING SHOT]

231
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:23,935
You took the lives of my people

232
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:26,802
to create a
Philosopher's Stone?!

233
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,235
[SCAR]
What happened to this Stone?!

234
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:32,269
[MARCOH] It was given to
Major Solf J. Kimblee.

235
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:35,669
He was known as the
Crimson Alchemist.

236
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,702
Did you see what
this man looked like...?

237
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:39,702
Did he have
black hair and cold eyes?

238
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:41,335
[MARCOH]
Yes...

239
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:44,269
[SCAR]
My brother...

240
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:47,569
[SCAR]
Keep talking.

241
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:49,302
Eh-everything changed...

242
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:52,302
that single stone turned
the battle around.

243
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:57,469
[KIMBLEE]
Ahh... What a beautiful sound.

244
00:15:57,469 --> 00:15:59,369
It doesn't get
any better than that...

245
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:01,635
I can feel it
deep in my bones...

246
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:03,869
Like a part of me
I never noticed before...

247
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:06,535
That sound is an
extension of my being.

248
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:09,502
And this land... This land
that's governed by death,

249
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:13,269
I will paint it red with this
shard of destruction.

250
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:16,769
I couldn't dream
of a more fulfilling job!

251
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:22,702
[EXPLOSIONS AND SCREAMS]

252
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:28,635
[KIMBLEE] Such a beautiful
sound...! Like a symphony...!

253
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:31,169
This stone is amazing!

254
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:36,569
It didn't take long after that.

255
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:39,269
The Ishvalans were slaughtered.

256
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:43,802
[HAWKEYE] With no other options,
the Ishvalans surrendered...

257
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:46,269
The High Priest of Ishvala,
Logue Lowe,

258
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:49,769
offered himself to the Fuhrer
on behalf of his people.

259
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:53,635
[BRADLEY] So... You're asking
me to take your life in place

260
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:56,802
of the remaining tens of
thousands of Ishvalans.

261
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:58,535
[LOWE]
That's correct... I stand--

262
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:00,802
[BRADLEY]
How arrogant of you.

263
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,535
Do you sincerely believe
that your single life is

264
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:07,335
equivalent to the remaining
multitude of your followers...?

265
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:09,802
Your stature has
gone to your head.

266
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:14,202
The life of any individual
human is only worth one life...

267
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,635
That's all--nothing more
and nothing less.

268
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,335
[BRADLEY CONTINUES]
Your life is not enough to

269
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,802
call off the extermination.

270
00:17:19,802 --> 00:17:21,269
How can you be so inhuman?!

271
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:23,235
You will suffer the
hammer of God!

272
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:26,469
[BRADLEY] God, you say...?
Now this is intriguing...

273
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:28,535
How much longer
do you think your "God"

274
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:31,935
plans to wait before
unleashing his fury?

275
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:34,302
Just how many
thousands of lives must

276
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:36,902
I take before he decides
to strike me down?

277
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,402
[MONK 3]
You're a monster!

278
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:39,669
[BRADLEY]
Open your eyes...

279
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:41,669
God is nothing more
than a construct,

280
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:45,535
created by man to inspire
fear and promote order...

281
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:47,902
If you wish to see
me struck down

282
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,535
for all of these atrocities...

283
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,902
Use your own hands
to do so... Not God's.

284
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,402
[HAWKEYE]
And that's it.

285
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:02,535
The war soon ended.

286
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:06,635
And we were all discharged
and returned to our homes.

287
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:10,735
Now we know. We really are as
expendable as garbage to them.

288
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:15,535
Yeah... The power of one man...
It doesn't amount to much.

289
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:19,369
But that doesn't matter... With
what little strength I have...

290
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:23,869
I'll do whatever it takes...
to protect the people I love...

291
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:28,269
And in turn... they'll protect
the one's they love...

292
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:32,302
It seems like the least we tiny
humans can do for each other.

293
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:52,435
So you've decided to
take this path after all...

294
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:55,435
Even after what you
went through in Ishval.

295
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,802
Yes, sir.

296
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,869
[HAWKEYE]
If the world truly operates

297
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,635
based on the principals of
equivalent exchange,

298
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:04,235
then we soldiers
have plenty to give back.

299
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:06,402
If this world is
meant to prosper,

300
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:08,869
then it is our duty to
carry the bodies of the dead

301
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:12,569
across a river of blood
to their resting place.

302
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:17,402
[ROY] From now on...
I'm assigning you to

303
00:19:17,402 --> 00:19:18,735
be my assistant...

304
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:21,769
I feel like I can trust you
to watch my back.

305
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:26,469
Although... I expect you
understand what this means...

306
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:29,535
You'll be able to shoot me
in the back as well.

307
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,735
[ROY] If I ever deviate
from this path,

308
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,769
then I want you to shoot me.

309
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:37,269
And I'm trusting you to do so.

310
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:39,469
[ROY]
Do you accept my offer?

311
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,469
Of course I do, sir.

312
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:44,835
[HAWKEYE] I'll follow you into
hell if you ask me to.

313
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:51,309
[ED] But even if the Colonel
does become the Fuhrer...

314
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:52,542
How will that change the fact

315
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:55,209
that this is still
a military state?

316
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,609
[HAWKEYE] Well it won't...
The first thing we'll have to do

317
00:19:57,609 --> 00:19:59,576
is restore power
to the parliament...

318
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,542
We'll take it back
from the military...

319
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,276
And make it democratic again.

320
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:05,776
[HAWKEYE] Only after
the full extent of the

321
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:08,076
military's corruption has
been brought to light

322
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,642
can this country
move forward...

323
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,709
What d'you mean?

324
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,142
[HAWKEYE] For example,
those who were praised as

325
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:15,776
heroes during the Ishvalan
campaign will be brought

326
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:18,309
to trial as war criminals.

327
00:20:19,242 --> 00:20:21,742
That's right... In a
just, peaceful world...

328
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:25,376
After all that we've done...
we'll be seen as mass murderers.

329
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:28,076
[ED] And the Colonel is trying
to make sure this happens...?

330
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:31,109
Isn't that just like
committing suicide?

331
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,442
But the Homunculi were
the ones pulling the strings...

332
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,309
They caused the civil war.

333
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:39,109
Even if they were the
ones responsible for it,

334
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:42,442
we were the soldiers
who carried it out.

335
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,142
[HAWKEYE] You should never avert
your eyes from death...

336
00:20:46,142 --> 00:20:48,542
Never forget the
people you've killed...

337
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:52,109
Trust me. No matter how
much time passes,

338
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:55,209
they will never forget
the ones who killed them.

339
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,642
[ED]
It's not right.

340
00:20:57,742 --> 00:21:00,342
You don't have time to
start worrying about us...

341
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,209
Your hands are already full...

342
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:04,309
You need to look
after your brother, Ed...

343
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:07,142
And you need to
get your bodies back.

344
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,076
[HAWKEYE] You better get to it.
You've got plenty of

345
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:11,409
people waiting for that day.

346
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:19,409
[ED] I'll get our bodies back...
And Al will help me.

347
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:22,676
[AL] Good night, Dr. Knocs...
Sorry for the intrusion.

348
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:25,542
[MAY CHANG]
Excuse me... Mr. Armor?

349
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,642
I just wanted to thank
you for your help...

350
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:29,776
You saved both of our lives.

351
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:33,342
[AL] My name's not Mr. Armor...
It's Alphonse Elric.

352
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:35,109
[MAY CHANG]
Your name is Elric?

353
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:37,342
[AL] You remember
Edward Elric, don't you...?

354
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,342
The little alchemist
you screamed at...?

355
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:41,576
Well I'm actually his
younger brother.

356
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:45,242
[AL] It's kind of a long story,
but I lost my body.

357
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:47,476
[MAY CHANG] So you're his
younger brother, huh...?

358
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:49,676
You probably look
just like him, then.

359
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:53,342
[AL] How rude! For starters, I'm
way taller than my brother is!

360
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:55,376
And I don't have a
mean face like his...

361
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:58,042
And I'm a much
better fighter too!

362
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:02,409
[AL] And I don't have a temper
like he does. I'm a gentleman.

363
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:06,076
[MAY CHANG]
Oh, Alphonse!

364
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,276
[MAY CHANG] I really hope that
you get your body back soon.

365
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:11,309
[AL]
Oh... Well thank you.

366
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:47,409
[ENVY] Hope you're decent,
Doc. It's time for your supper.

367
00:23:48,076 --> 00:23:50,742
[ENVY] Huhhh... It sure
is quiet in here.

368
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:54,976
Are you thinking about Ishval
and crying yourself to sleep?

369
