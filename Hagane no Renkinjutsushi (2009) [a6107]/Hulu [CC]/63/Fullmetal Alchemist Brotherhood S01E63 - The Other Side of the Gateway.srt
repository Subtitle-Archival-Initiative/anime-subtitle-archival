[HOMUNCULUS] Don't you even
want freedom... Hohenheim?

2
00:00:07,835 --> 00:00:09,960
Are you going to live out
the rest of your life

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,625
as a slave, without the
rights of a real man?

4
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:17,458
In that case, you're
no different from me,

5
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,125
trapped inside
this stuffy flask.

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,960
<i>How can a mere human...</i>

<i>A meager alchemist...</i>

[BRIGGS SOLDIER 1]
He did it!

00:00:57,793 --> 00:00:59,875
[BRIGGS SOLDIERS 2] He saved us!
The little runt saved us!

Stay on your feet, moron!

00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,083
[BRIGGS SOLDIERS 3]
Uh... Sorry.

24
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,250
[FATHER]
A Stone...

[FATHER]
Philosopher's Stonnnne!

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,875

your stone, Greed...!

[GREED]
Let go, dumbass...!

00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,375
You're gonna get
dragged in with me!

[LING]
No way...!

33
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:54,418
I'm not letting
you go that easily...

34
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:56,708
I need you with me if
I'm gonna be emperor!

35
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,125
[GREED]
Just let go...!

36
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,291
My entire being was
extracted from his greed...!

37
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,500
And the power that's
trying to reclaim me

38
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,875
is a hell of a lot
stronger than your body!

39

[LING] You can't
just give up...!

40
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:08,750
Tough it out!

41
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,918
Oh, no!

42
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:14,000

My body!

[GREED]
Y'know...

45
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,125
It's not quite as ideal
as being king of the world...

46
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,835
but I can make do
with emperor of Xing.

47

him together...

Eh, partner?

00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:33,041

[LING]
What are you...?

00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,708
[GREED] It's time
to say goodbye, kid...

There's no point
in you getting sucked

53
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,125
into my old man with me.

54
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,543
[LING] Hold on
a second, Greed...!

55
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:50,208
You just told me
we'd fight together!

56
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,418
Didn't you...?!

57
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:54,250
You can't just
sucker punch me like that!

58
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,708
How could you lie...?!

59
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,000
You always said you don't
believe in telling lies...!

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,291
It can't end this way!

61
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,458
[GREED]
Hahahahaha!

62
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,750
You fell for it hook,
line, and sinker,

63
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,291
you little pissant!

64
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,250
[GREED] That was the one
and only lie of my life.

65
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,125
[GREED] Lan Fan has
a Philosopher's Stone...

66
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,333
So you don't even
need me anymore, kid.

67
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,793

But I do...

68
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:18,708
[GREED]
Hahahaha!

69
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,960
[LING]
Wait, Greed.

70
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,668
[LING] No, wait...!
Don't do this!

71
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:25,793

Hey...! Lan Fan!

72
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,918

No, Greed!

[FATHER]
How could you?!

76
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,543
[FATHER]
Greed!

77
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,375
[GREED]
Muwahaha!

78
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,250
I finally got away
from that annoying brat.

79
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,500
[FATHER]
Why Greed...?!

80
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,918
Why would you betray
your own father?!

81
00:03:55,918 --> 00:03:58,250
[GREED] I've always had
a rebellious streak, pops...

82
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,083
Don't act so surprised.

83
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,875
[GREED] I've reversed
the ultimate shield you gave me.

84
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,333
And transformed your body

85
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,918
into the most
fragile carbon there is!

86
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:10,333
[FATHER]
You crafty devil.

87
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,291
[FATHER]
Be gone, fool...!

88
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,250
Return to nothing!

Greed!

00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,291
[GREED]
Ah, damn it...

91
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,208
Looks like this is the end.

92
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:36,083
[GREED] I could do
without that pitiful look

93
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,625
right now, you pissant.

94
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,250
[LING]
You're wrong, Greed...!

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,125
They'll always
be a part of you!

00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:44,708
[LING] Friends are

you team up with us?

98

[ED]
You've got nothing...

99
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:50,083
Why not come with us?

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,458
[GREED] I can't
believe I let Ling

101
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,918
and the little runt
talk to me that way.

102
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,083
[GREED]
I've had enough.

103
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:07,041
Yeah... That's
all I really need.

104
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,918
They gave me
everything I could want.

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,333
[HOHENHEIM]
That's it.

110
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,835
[FATHER]
My Stone...

111
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:52,000
You destroyed my Stone.

112
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:00,875
[FATHER] What...?
This can't...

113
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,583
What is this?

114
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:07,583
[ED] Go back
to where you were born...

115
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,960
Go back to nothing...
Homunculus!

116
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,375
[FATHER]
But why...?

117
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,125
I just wanted
to understand...

118
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,918
this world's knowledge!

119
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,458
[FATHER] I wanted
to experience it!

120
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:32,418
Free...! I just
wanted to be free!

121
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:35,041
Free to knowwww!

122
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:50,333
[HOMUNCULUS]
Tell me...

123
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,083
Why did you
refuse to join me?

124
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,291
Why, God...?!

125
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,166
How did I disappoint you?

126
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,250
[TRUTH] You were incapable
of believing in yourself.

127
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,750
[TRUTH] You stole your
power from others...

128
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,375
You rejected
your human origins...

129
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,668
and chose to covet
the power of what you call God.

130
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:12,750
[TRUTH] You never grew
beyond your days in the flask.

131
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,041
Did you truly think
you'd become superior

132
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,208
to humans by removing
your seven desires?

133
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,750
[TRUTH]
Don't make me laugh.

134
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,960
[HOMUNCULUS]
What's wrong with that...?

135
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,375
I only wanted
to obtain perfection...

136
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,375
I wanted this world's
knowledge for my own!

137
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,333
Why should
I be punished for that...?!

138
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,333
What's wrong with
craving knowledge...?

139
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,875
What's wrong with
seeking perfection?!

140
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,250
Well, speak...!

141
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,333
What are you, anyway...?

142
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:43,000
Do you even have a name...?

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,750
Who the hell do
you think you are?!

144
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,875
[TRUTH]
Who am I?

145
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,793
One name you might have
for me is "the world"...

146
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:54,125
Or you might call
me "the universe"...

147
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,750
or perhaps "God"...

148
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,875
or perhaps "the truth"...

149
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,250
I am all...
and I am one...

150
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,500
So of course...

151
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,250
this also means
that I am you.

152
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,375
I'm the truth
of your despair...

153
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:10,583
the inescapable price
of your boastfulness.

154
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,543
[FATHER] Humans who
would dare to play god

155
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,750
must pay a steep price
for their arrogance...

156
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,625
[FATHER]
That is Truth.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,208
[TRUTH]
And now...

158
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,875
I will bestow upon you
the despair you deserve.

159
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:34,375
[HOMUNCULUS]
Don't do this to me...

160
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:38,333
I can't... I can't go back!

161
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,375
Please, stop...!

162
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,543
I can't bear
to be bound any longer!

163
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,835
Ahhh!!

164
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:51,000
No...! No...! Nooo!

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,875
[TRUTH] This despair is
reserved for the boastful.

166
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,583
[HOMUNCULUS] Just tell me
what I was supposed to do!

167
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,918
[TRUTH] You brought
this outcome upon yourself.

168
00:08:58,918 --> 00:08:59,875
[HOMUNCULUS]
What'd I do wrong?

169
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,750
What should I have done?!

170
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,208
[slam]

171
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
[TRUTH] You simply must
have seen the answer

172
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,918
with your own eyes.

173
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:22,708
[ROY]
What happened...?

174
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,625
Is it over...? Did we win?

175
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,543
[HAWKEYE]
Yes, sir... Although...

176

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,875
[YOUNG HOHENHEIM]
Okay then,

349
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,708
what is it that
makes you happy?

350
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,960
[HOMUNCULUS]
Well...

351
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,918
I'd hate to be guilty
of asking too much,

352
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:26,083
but I think I'd be happy if I
could just leave this flask...

353
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,750
[HOHENHEIM]
You were born of my blood...

354
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,000
dwarf in the flask... Homunculus.

355
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,125
[HOHENHEIM]
In the end...

356
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,500
You and I were still as one...

357
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:42,918
And I'm...

358
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,875
[ARMSTRONG]
Mr. Hohenheim.

359
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,083
[ARMSTRONG] I personally
saw to it that your sons

360
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,918
were admitted to the hospital.

361
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:55,750
[HOHENHEIM]
Thank you.

362
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,960
I'm grateful for your help.

363
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
[ARMSTRONG]
Nonsense...

364
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,333
I'm the one who's
truly grateful.

365
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,208
[ARMSTRONG]
We're all in debt

366
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,543
to the efforts of
Edward and Alphonse...

367
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:08,835
Without those boys'
relentless courage...

368
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:11,918
this nation
would be no more...

369
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,875
Thank you very much.

370
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,041
[HOHENHEIM]
Thank you.

371
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,668
[HOHENHEIM]
Hello, Trisha... I'm home.

372
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,543
So get this...

373
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:16,835
Ed actually called
me his father.

374
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,083
Although he did
preface it with "rotten."

375
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,250
Living through all of
these endless years...

376
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,500
I always felt like I'd
been struck with a curse.

377
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,708
But then I found you
and we had our sons...

378
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,793
and I suddenly felt blessed...

379
00:21:36,793 --> 00:21:39,960
Grateful for the life I had.

380
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,000
I've had a fulfilling life...

381
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:45,375
Thanks to you...

382
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,041
It's been enough.

383
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,041
Thank you... Trisha.

384
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,793
But now...

385
00:21:57,793 --> 00:21:58,835
Believe it or not,

386
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:01,418
I actually want
to keep on living.

387
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,500
I guess I'm pretty hopeless...

388
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,291
Aren't I, Trisha?

389
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,125
[PINAKO]
Hohenheim?

390
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,333
I didn't know
you were back.

391
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,835
Silly old fool.

392
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:29,458
Well, at least you
died with a smile

393
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,875
on your face, my friend.

394
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,668
[NARRATOR] There's no such thing
as an absolute and final ending,

395
00:24:06,668 --> 00:24:10,166
for it is always followed
by a new beginning.

396
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:13,333
The future is yours
to shape as you wish.

397
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:17,208
Craft it with hope upon
a foundation of peace.

398
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:20,668
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.

399
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:24,750
The final episode:
"Journey's End."

400
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,708
Step forward. Embrace your life
and the world that nurtures it.
