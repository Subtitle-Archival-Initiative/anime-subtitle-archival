356
00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:42,877
Yeah, well...

357
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,177
I'd rather beat
you senseless...

358
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:45,677
And it makes me sick

359
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:47,510
to have to ask
you for help.

360
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,543
But right now...

361
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:50,143
we need to save
this girl's life.

362
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,510
What do you
plan on doing?

363
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,677
I don't understand it...

364
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:58,777
but for some reason
I'm important to them.

365
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,210
They're not
gonna kill me...

366
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,943
They said they
need me alive.

367
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,977
I doubt that I'd be able

368
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:05,210
to get her safely
to the surface

369
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,943
with the condition
I'm in right now...

370
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:09,843
And I have no intention
of turning my back

371
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:12,877
on this place just yet!

372
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:15,877
Wait, what
are you doing?

373
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:29,043
Geez...! Couldn't you
have warned me first...?

374
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:31,077
What a rude thing to do.

375
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:34,543
[ENVY]
I guess you
think it was clever,

376
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:36,977
igniting the
hydrogen like that?

377
00:20:38,577 --> 00:20:39,943
Where did he go?

378
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:41,543
You better tell me now!

379
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:43,077
[AL]
I have no idea!

380
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:46,110
[ENVY]
Get up and track
his scent, Gluttony!

381
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,210
You've used up your
regenerative power...!

382
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,243
Your body's dying.

383
00:20:55,543 --> 00:20:57,077
That was a good solid kick...

384
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:59,843
This should be more
entertaining than I expected!

385
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,643
You idiot prince!

386
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:05,777
Wake up, Ling!

387
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:06,910
The name's Greed.

388
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,477
Shut up...

389
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,110
Give Ling his body back!

390
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,277
[GREED]
Sorry,
can't do that!

391
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:15,843
[FIGHTING NOISES]

392
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:18,943
Give up already, you idiot!

393
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:20,577
What about your country...?!

394
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:23,610
Have you forgotten
all about Lan Fan?!

395
00:21:31,843 --> 00:21:33,077
[GREED]
Hey, Pops...!

396
00:21:33,077 --> 00:21:35,010
I caught 'im for you.

397
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,777
Upstairs... I want him
taken directly to Wrath.

398
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:42,010
Man... you guys
really made a mess

399
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,143
of things,
didn't you...

400
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:46,110
[ENVY]
If you had simply
behaved yourselves,

401
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,943
then we would've let
you go a long time ago.

402
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,677
[AL]
Brother.

403
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:56,077
He's in there...
I know it.

404
00:21:56,077 --> 00:21:58,110
Ling's alive.

405
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,210
[FATHER]
I see that you've exhausted

406
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,510
the regenerative
powers of the Stone.

407
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,943
There's no need to worry...

408
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:42,977
Fear not, my son.

409
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,810
I'll recreate you
when the time is right.

410
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,843
With all of your
memories intact.

411
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,843
[NARRATOR]
Humans will always be
drawn to create chaos

412
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:07,577
around them and they
will always choose

413
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:09,877
to spend their days in pain.

414
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:12,877
This is what reminds
them that they are alive.

415
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:15,110
But if this is the
reminder that you need,

416
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,843
kneel before me
and I'll show you

417
00:24:16,843 --> 00:24:19,177
just how alive you are.

418
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:22,010
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.

419
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,977
Episode Twenty-nine...
Struggle of the Fool.

420
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:27,610
Is a man still
capable of standing

421
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,777
if his arms and legs
have been taken from him?
