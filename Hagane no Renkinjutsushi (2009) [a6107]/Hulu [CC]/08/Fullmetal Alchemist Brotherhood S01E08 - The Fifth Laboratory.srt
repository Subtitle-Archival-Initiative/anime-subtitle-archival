00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:40,782
[ED] Yeah, it
makes me sick...

more than one idiot

73

slated for execution...

Tell me something then...
This laboratory...

83
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:08,082
Are they using condemned
prisoners like you

84
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:10,448
to make Philosopher's
Stones here?

85
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:11,582
[48] That I
can't tell you.

86
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:13,548
It isn't my area...

00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:16,048
They simply
recognized my skills...

88
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:17,148
gave me this body,

89
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:19,448
and made me their
trusty guard dog.

Interesting...

91
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:22,415
I'm sure they gave
you a seal too--

92
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:24,882

between soul and armor?

93
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:28,582
[48] Yes...
I have a bloodseal.

98
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:40,882

a little extra challenge

102
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:49,548
Why not just let me go?

103
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:50,782
[48]
Nice try, kid...

104
00:05:50,782 --> 00:05:53,048
but what kind
of mass murderer

105
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:56,082
lets his prey
get away so easily?

106
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:58,848

Now... let's fight.

You should see her.

116
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:14,748
[ROY] I'm sure
she's adorable,

117
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:17,415
but stop calling me to
gush over your daughter...

118
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:19,082
and on a military line, too!

119
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:21,115
[HUGHES] Not just
my daughter, colonel...

120
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,648
I'll gush over
my wife, too!

121
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:27,115
[HUGHES] I know, I know,
it's your turn now...!

122

Go ahead, Colonel...

gush over your very own...

Scar-faced Ishvalan.

125
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:35,882
[ROY] We've
found many bodies

on the site
where he vanished...

127
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,115
But all of them
are so decomposed

128
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:43,415
that it's been difficult
to identify them.

129
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:45,582
[ROY] He hasn't been
sighted anywhere in the east.

130
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:46,782
[ROY]
So at the present,

131
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,482
many people here think it's
most likely that he's dead.

132
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:50,382
[HUGHES] If that's the case,

133
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:51,948
I should be able to
lift the bodyguard

134
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:54,048

135
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:55,482

protective detail?

137
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,148

you left outside.

173
00:08:35,753 --> 00:08:38,786
[ED] Is this companion
of yours strong?

174
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,620
[48]
Yes he is...

175
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,453
He isn't as strong
as I am, though.

176
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,553
[ED]
Hahaha!

177
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:52,086
[ED] In that case
I don't need to worry...

178
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,053
You see...

179
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:55,486
We've been sparring
partners a long time...

180
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:57,620
And I've still
never beaten him!

181
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:04,520
[66] Damn it...!

182
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,386
Why can't ya sit
still for a second

183
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:09,553
and let me cut you up,
you big bucket of bolts!

184
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:11,686
Rrgggh! Augggh!

185
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:21,986
You're empty!

186
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:24,086
[66]
Hahaha!

187
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:27,386
[66] There's a bit of
a story behind that.

188
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:28,886
[66] Would ya
like to hear...?

189
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:30,553
It's a pretty good yarn...

190
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:32,620
You probably already
know it, though.

191
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,353
It all starts with a
man by the name of Barry.

192
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:39,686
[66] Once upon a time,

193
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,053
right here in Central,

194
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:42,686
there was a
butcher named Barry

195
00:09:42,686 --> 00:09:44,386
who loved his work...

196
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:45,720
His favorite part
was cutting up

197
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,520
the meat into little,
tiny pieces...

198
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,486
But one day, Barry
found that cutting up

199
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,620
beef and pork wasn't
enough anymore...

200
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,353
So he took to the
streets and began

201
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:58,486
cutting up people
instead, night after night.

202
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:02,020
[66] In time, of course,
Barry was caught...

203
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,886
but not before
twenty-three victims

204
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:06,886
had fallen prey to
him and his knife.

205
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:10,486
[66] Naturally, after
terrorizing Central for so long,

206
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,486
Barry was sent to the
gallows for his wicked deeds...

207
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:16,953
and the world was happily
rid of yet another evil man.

208
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:20,353
[66] At least, that's what
everyone out there believes...

209
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,120
But our story
isn't over yet.

210
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,053
We haven't even
reached the good part.

211
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:26,353
Barry isn't actually
dead, you see...

212
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:28,086
He's very much alive and

213
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,786
charged with guarding
a certain place--

214
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:33,620
only, without his body...

215
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,886
[66]
Yes, that's right...!

216
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:37,420
He's standing in front
of your very eyes...!

217
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,820
I am the infamous serial
killer, Barry the Chopper!

218
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:45,053
[AL] Sorry, I've
never heard of you.

219
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:49,586
[AL] I'm from a little
town in the east, so--

220
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,486
[66] Fine, but even if
you don't know who I am,

221
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:53,586
shouldn't you at least
be a little scared...?!

222
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,120
Shouldn't you
be going, "AHHH!"

223
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,986
or "What happened
to your body?!"

224
00:10:56,986 --> 00:10:58,486
Or Something!?

225
00:10:58,486 --> 00:10:59,253
AHHH...!

226
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:01,386
What happened to
your body, freak?!

227
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:03,620
[AL] Hey... now
that's impolite.

228
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,420
[66] Oh! I see! You
were on death row too.

229
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,753
You had me
startled there.

230
00:11:07,753 --> 00:11:09,853
[AL] No way!
I'm not a criminal!

231
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:12,420
[66] Huh? Then what
happened to you?

232
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,420
[AL]
It's kind of a long story.

233
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,486
When I lost my body,

234
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:16,886
my brother
transmuted my soul

235
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:19,020
and bonded it to this armor.

236
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,053
[66 laughing]
Your brother?

237
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:23,653
Of course! Your brother!

238
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:25,353
[AL] What's so
funny about it?

239
00:11:25,353 --> 00:11:26,120
[66]
Hahaha!

240
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,520
Are you sure you
and your brother

241
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,453
are really related?

242
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,353
[AL] Well,
I guess we don't look

243
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:31,920
that much
alike anymore...

244
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,486
[66] No, no, no...
That's not what I mean.

245
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,120
[66] Are you sure
that you're not a puppet

246
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,386
created and controlled
by your so-called brother?

247
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:43,086
[66] Were you ever even a
real person to begin with?

248
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:45,520
[AL] How can you ask
something like that...?!

249
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,620
I was a real boy,

250
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,620
and my name was
Alphonse Elric!

251
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
[66]
Hahahah!

252
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,086
How can you be
so sure of that?

253
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,620
[AL]
I have memories!

254
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,820
I remember who
I was before.

255
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,553
[66]
And who's to say

256
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:57,386
those memories
aren't made up?

257
00:11:58,086 --> 00:12:01,020
[AL] But Winry and
Granny--they know me!

258
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,353
[66] That's easy...
They're in on it too.

259
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:04,586
[AL gasps]

260
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:05,453
[66] Silly boy...

261
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:07,620
You were never
alive to begin with...

262
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,786
It's as simple as that.

263
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:10,453
[AL]
Then how do you know

264
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:11,820
that you were really alive?

265
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
[66]
I was, trust me.

266
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,320
[PATROLMAN] This area
is off limits! Don't move!

267
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,686
[66]
There, didja see that?

268
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:20,920
There's nothing I love more

269
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,620
than chopping up live people.

270
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,753
I can't control myself...

271
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:27,620
I kill, therefore I am...

272
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,853
As long as I know that,
it's all I need to prove

273
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:32,653
to myself that
I've always been me.

274
00:12:35,686 --> 00:12:37,820
[48] Your brother
is that good, is he...?

275
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,653
Then I'll have to hurry up

276
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:40,686
and defeat you
so I can get around

277
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:42,520
to taking care of him.

278
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:49,753

Go Al! Do it now!

What?

00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:47,285
about this mass
murderer, Slicer.

297
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,218

His crimes

298

there's no such thing

No. I'm not a murderer.

00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:23,218
[AL] I told you!
I'm not a puppet!

you know for sure?

Destroy it... Go ahead,
break it yourself...

Oh, no...?

00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:53,885
Then I guess I'll have
to do it for you, won't I?

348
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:56,051
[ED] I know that my

00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:58,785
That means you

350
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:01,051
I will not take the
life of another person.

351
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:07,085
[48 (YOUNGER)]
Brother?

352
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:08,718
[48] My brother and

353
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,018
stealing, cheating,
and killing together

354

for as long as
we can remember.

00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:14,851
[48] And now that we're
in these pseudo-bodies,

356
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:18,018
we're being treated like
humans for the first time...

Don't you see the irony?

[48] For that, boy, I'll
give you a parting gift...

I'll tell you everything...

360
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,018
I'll tell you who made
the Philosopher's Stone...

361
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:30,051

to guard this place.

raring to go--

Oh, do excuse me...

00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,018
I was just recalling

Not bad at all.

488
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:32,918

Watch yourself, though.

489
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:33,651

You can't move up

from someone who
knows the game.

495
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:44,718

your hands on now, Colonel...

00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:19,385
