1
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:36,479
[sounds of hammering,
construction]

2
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,112
[Hohenheim] It's been
a long time, huh, Al?

3
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:41,334
[Al] Yeah.

4
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:44,867
[Hohenheim] So, uh...
I saw Pinako recently.

5
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:47,201
She told me about your body.

6
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:57,834
[Resident]
Hey... There he is.

7
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,001
[Al] Uh...?

8
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:01,767
Mr. Ho! You think you could
give us a hand for a bit?

9
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:04,901
Yeah, sure. Um...
Let's catch up later.

10
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,167
[Al] Oh... okay.

11
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,701
[Older Man] You did a helluva
job fixin' up this old radio.

12
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:19,134
It works better
than it used to.

13
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:21,467
It doesn't even
pick up static now.

14
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:26,934
[Al] I'm really sorry...

15
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,734
All this bad stuff happened
because we stuck our noses in.

16
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,534
Mm, don't say that.
You've gotta look

17
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,501
at all the good stuff
that's come from it.

18
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,467
You guys exposed
a corrupt fraud.

19
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:39,367
People reacted badly
at first, but take a look.

20
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:43,867
[sounds of hammering,
construction]

21
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:46,434
Sounds good, huh?
The whole town's working

22
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:48,601
together to rebuild
what we lost.

23
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,734
And you guys are the ones
that brought us together.

24
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:54,734
[Al] Mm...

25
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,267
I'm gonna help build.

26
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:58,667
Rose, can you
take care of Winry?

27
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,367
Well. We might
as well help, too.

28
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:04,767
[Zampano]
You heard him, Yoki.

29
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,767
Huh? I'm eating.

30
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:07,567
- [Gerso] Hmph.
- [Yoki] Aaahhh!

31
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,301
[Gerso]
Your food'll taste better

32
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:10,467
once you've worked
up an appetite.

33
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:11,801
[Zampano] Quit struggling.

34
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:15,301
[Yoki] C'mon, I'm hungry
now! Let go! Please!

35
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:19,401
Really? You mean that
was your son back there?

36
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:22,501
I'm sorry if we interrupted.
It's been a while, right?

37
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:24,534
Maybe you should
head back and talk?

38
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:27,167
I don't know... I left
when he was just a boy

39
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,734
and haven't seen him since...

40
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:31,434
I doubt that he thinks of me
as his father or trusts me.

41
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:33,667
I'm not even sure
what to say to him.

42
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:34,567
[Al] Hey, Dad!

43
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,201
[Hohenheim] Ah?

44
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:42,667
[Al] I, um... I'd
like to work, too.

45
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,767
[Hohenheim] Huh?

46
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:47,434
[Al] Here...
Let me carry those.

47
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,301
[Al] Here ya go.

48
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,696
[Winry stretches] Mmm...

49
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:02,191
[Rose] You okay in there?
How's the water feel?

50
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:04,424
[Winry] Amazing.

51
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:08,491
Ah... It feels like an
eternity since I've had a bath.

52
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:10,391
[Rose] I'll leave some
fresh clothes for you here.

53
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,457
Thank you so much, Rose.

54
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:14,524
[Winry sighs comfortably]

55
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:18,291
[Winry] <i>She's so nice
to do all this for me.</i>

56
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,157
I'm really impressed
with you, Winry.

57
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:22,091
Working as an
automail engineer,

58
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,757
you're so independent
for someone your age.

59
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:26,957
So did you design Ed's leg?

60
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:28,291
That's right...
That was back when

61
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,391
we were just
little kids, really.

62
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:33,057
That's amazing...
You're the one who literally

63
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:35,324
helped Ed get back
on his feet again...

64
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:39,024
So you indirectly helped me
get back on my feet too...

65
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:42,257
I owe you just as much
as I owe Ed and Al.

66
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:43,457
[Winry] Ah...

67
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:48,757
[Rose] I was desperate enough
to believe Father Cornello.

68
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:51,024
He claimed that he could bring
my boyfriend back to life,

69
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,257
and I began to
blindly follow him.

70
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,857
But lucky for me, that's
when Ed and Al showed up

71
00:04:56,857 --> 00:05:01,257
and proved that his
miracles were just alchemy.

72
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,891
Everything I believed in
suddenly disappeared.

73
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:06,191
I lost all hope.

74
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:12,091
But then Ed got
furious with me...

75
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:14,991
He told me to stand
on my own two feet.

76
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:18,757
He said that? He can
be a jerk sometimes.

77
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:22,857
I don't know why it's so
difficult for him to be nice.

78
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:26,791
But he was being nice.
That's just how much he cares.

79
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,357
But you already
know that, don't you?

80
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:34,091
Huh? Um...

81
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:38,024
He helped open our eyes...
Mine, and the whole town's.

82
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:41,124
[sounds of hammering,
construction]

83
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,291
[Rose] We're learning
to stand on our own.

84
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:47,091
And we don't need any
kind of miracle to do it.

85
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:49,724
It's all thanks to Ed and Al.

86
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:54,024
[Winry] <i>Ed...</i>

87
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:58,124
[Bido] Maybe it wasn't
such a bright idea

88
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,957
to follow those military guys.

89
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:02,424
I have no idea
where the hell I am.

90
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:06,291
Where are you,
Mr. Greed? Ah--!

91
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:10,457
[Bido pants]

92
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:13,757
[Bido struggles]

93
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:17,891
[Bido groans]

94
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:19,424
[Bido screams] Yaaaah!!

95
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:22,424
[Bido trembles]

96
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,424
[Bido gasps]

97
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:30,091
[Bido trembles]

98
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,324
[Gardner] The state has
no interest in ethics.

99
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:35,924
They're too much of a variable
to use as a guideline.

100
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,757
[Gardner] The third tenant
is to prevent someone

101
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:43,124
from creating their
own army... General.

102
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,191
But... These aren't...

103
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:48,157
They aren't human, are they?

104
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,224
Correct. They're like
humanoid receptacles...

105
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:54,924
Powerful dummies that
we can bond souls to.

106
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:59,057
Not only are they immortal,
they're mindlessly obedient.

107
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:02,124
They are the world's
most perfect soldier.

108
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:04,824
Mind if I ask you
a question, sir?

109
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,291
[Gardner] Go right ahead.

110
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,091
You mentioned that souls
would be bonded to them...

111
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:12,124
Where do you plan on
procuring these souls?

112
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:15,757
From rival lands, of course.
Citizens from the countries

113
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:18,324
we ravage during
the course of war.

114
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:21,191
For one reason or
another, the battlefield

115
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:25,291
serves as a hunting ground
for the collection of souls.

116
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,224
[Bido screams] Yaaaahh!

117
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:31,024
This place is evil! Pure evil!
Why did I ever come here?!

118
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:34,291
Mister Greed would never be
in an awful place like this!

119
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,907
[Hohenheim]
An underground tunnel?

120
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:48,859
[Al] Uh-huh. And I've got a
hunch that it runs under Liore.

121
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:51,692
If it does-- well, no,
I'm positive it does--

122
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:55,025
Hold on, Al... Let's find
someplace more private.

123
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,625
So it's a country-wide
transmutation circle...

124
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,125
And you plan on destroying it?

125
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:06,492
[Al] Yeah. So I was kind of
shocked to find you here, Dad.

126
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:09,159
I must have some
good luck after all.

127
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:12,892
We encountered a man who was
identical to you in Central.

128
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,959
I don't know how you're
connected to him...

129
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,359
but I'm guessing you at
least know who he is, right?

130
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,659
[Hohenheim] Are you sure
you want to know, Al?

131
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:23,159
[Al] Uh--!

132
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,125
Did it ever cross your mind
I might be on their side?

133
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:26,992
[Al gasps]

134
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:29,092
You've given away
your entire plan.

135
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,059
Aren't you the least bit worried
I might leak it to them?

136
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,759
[Al] Ah...!

137
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:44,992
I'm glad that you feel like
you can still trust me.

138
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,692
Thanks, Alphonse...

139
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,059
[Al] Ah... Sure!

140
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,392
[Hohenheim]
<i>Even though I left them...</i>

141
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:55,659
<i>This boy still sees me as his
father and actually trusts me.</i>

142
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:58,692
<i>Now then... I suppose
I owe my sons</i>

143
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:01,092
<i>the same trust
they've given me.</i>

144
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,659
This won't be
easy to explain...

145
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:07,992
It would be for the best
for Edward to hear it as well.

146
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:09,892
[Al gasps]

147
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:12,959
[Al] Actually,
I hate to say it...

148
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,992
But Brother has gone missing.

149
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:23,859
[background chatter,
phone ringing]

150
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:26,792
Next in line, please.

151
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:29,592
[Teller] Mmm--!

152
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:30,659
[Darius] I'd like
to make a withdrawal

153
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:33,725
from the account of State
Alchemist Edward Elric.

154
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:35,692
His research account.

155
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,559
[Teller] Are you
the account holder?

156
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,892
[Darius] I'm his representative...

157
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:41,125
But I've brought a
letter of attorney.

158
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:44,859
Thank you for your
business, sir.

159
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,959
This is the Bank of Amestris,
Northern Branch...

160
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,559
We've just had a very
large withdrawal

161
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,825
taken from State
Alchemist Edward Elric's

162
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:56,892
personal research account.

163
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:59,892
No. He claimed to be
his representative...

164
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,825
Well... He was rather
tall and very brawny.

165
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:05,925
[Darius] Here. That should
cover your medical bill.

166
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:07,859
[Doctor chuckles]

167
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:11,692
Well... I could charge
you more, but this'll do.

168
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:14,559
It better... You're already
ripping us off, doc.

169
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,925
How can you say that?

170
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:19,559
It's reasonable when you
consider the risks involved.

171
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,492
Sure. And as long as you
guarantee that you're

172
00:10:21,492 --> 00:10:23,825
gonna keep your mouths shut,
then I'm not complaining.

173
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:25,425
Darius.

174
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,025
Tch. I guess they found us.

175
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:36,559
Yes, hello...
Oh, you're soldiers.

176
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,825
Do you need a physical?

177
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:40,792
[Ivan]
We're looking for someone.

178
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:44,392
Is this man your only patient?
There's no one else?

179
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:46,592
There's one more resting-- ah!

180
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:55,759
Are you the only
patient back here?

181
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,759
Yeah. Why're you asking?
What's wrong?

182
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,659
Tell me. Were you at
the bank this afternoon?

183
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,025
[Darius grunts]

184
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:04,692
Don't move.

185
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:06,025
Huh?

186
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:10,825
Hold it... Do you work
at this doctor's office?

187
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:12,959
Slowly raise your
hands above your head.

188
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,692
[Darius grunts]

189
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,559
[Harris] Have you
seen anyone unusual

190
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,692
frequenting the clinic lately?

191
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:22,559
He's described as...

192
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,859
Right now! Show me your hands!

193
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:30,592
...a red coat, blond hair
worn in a braid, and short.

194
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,725
[sound of thud
and body falling]

195
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,092
Check it out.

196
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,592
[Cohen] Harris! Harris,
what happened to you?

197
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:39,659
C'mon, snap to! Harris!

198
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:41,592
[sound of thud
and body falling]

199
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:52,692
Cohen! Harris! What's
going on? Hey, answer me!

200
00:11:53,859 --> 00:12:00,992
[Ivan struggles]

201
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:03,592
[Ivan exhales]

202
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,692
Well, damn. You just
had to take 'em out

203
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:12,092
on your own, huh?
You're pretty reckless, kid.

204
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:14,959
You haven't even
fully recovered yet.

205
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,392
[Ed] Don't treat me
like I'm an invalid.

206
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:19,459
My injuries are
completely healed...

207
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:22,092
And I'm revving
at full throttle.

208
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,125
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

209
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:31,412
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

210
00:12:31,412 --> 00:12:33,724
[Darius] Thanks for
everything you've done, Doc.

211
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:36,291
Don't worry about it.
Just hurry up and go.

212
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,424
We've had about all the
trouble we can take for today.

213
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:43,358
[Ed] <i>That's all
they're looking for?</i>

214
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:45,958
<i>Someone with a red
coat and a braid?</i>

215
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,191
<i>Guess I'll have to make do
with this look for a while.</i>

216
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:50,991
[Soldier 1] Freeze!

217
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,291
[Soldier 2] Drop your weapons!

218
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,224
[Heinkel] We took too long.

219
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:57,058
Get your hands up
in the air! Do it now!

220
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,258
Move it, kid! Those
guys are dangerous!

221
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:02,058
[Ed chews, swallows]

222
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:03,258
[Darius and Heinkel grunt]

223
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:05,058
Stay back or he's dead!

224
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:07,958
Don't force us to blow
this kid's brains out!

225
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,324
[Soldiers gasp]

226
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:19,858
[Soldiers yell]

227
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:21,291
I'll hotwire some wheels for us.

228
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,424
Okay.

229
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:24,891
[sound of engine roar]

230
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,991
Hey, Gorilla! Step on it!

231
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:32,158
Don't call me that!

232
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,458
[Ed] Just drive faster!

233
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,258
These guys are from
Northern command.

234
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:37,024
We're never gonna ditch 'em!

235
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:39,724
[Darius yells] Aah!

236
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:44,124
That was a little too close.

237
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,924
How's it lookin' behind us?

238
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,124
[Ed] Not good...
They're right on us!

239
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:49,724
Damn it.

240
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:51,424
Turn there! I've got an idea!

241
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:52,091
What?

242
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,958
[Ed] Just shut up and turn!

243
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,958
Ahh...! This better
be a good plan!

244
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,724
Just park the car
as soon as we turn.

245
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,858
They turned!

246
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:06,791
What?

247
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,991
[Soldier 6] How...
Where did they go?

248
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,858
They must've turned on that
street up there! Move it!

249
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:19,891
[sound of engine idling]

250
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:25,024
Whew... And you doubted me.

251
00:14:25,024 --> 00:14:28,158
Yeah, well can you change it
back into a normal car now?

252
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,391
And why's that? I think
this car looks cool as hell.

253
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:34,858
[Darius] Just change it back.
Please, we're begging you.

254
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:38,124
[Ed] Oh, yeah? You guys got a
problem with my sense of style?

255
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:39,991
[Darius and Heinkel]
You don't have any!

256
00:14:44,724 --> 00:14:47,291
[Heinkel] So I guess this
means we're drifters again.

257
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,258
[Darius] Yep.

258
00:14:50,258 --> 00:14:53,091
[Ed] <i>I never should've dropped
my guard around Kimblee.</i>

259
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:56,324
<i>Talk about a setback.</i>

260
00:14:56,324 --> 00:15:00,391
<i>And Al... I hope he was
able to safely find Winry.</i>

261
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:04,458
[Darius] Hey, Fullmetal...
Quit spacin' out.

262
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,758
So what's the next
plan of action?

263
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:08,324
Well... let's see...

264
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,991
The first thing I need to
do is meet up with Al.

265
00:15:10,991 --> 00:15:13,358
He should be with
Dr. Marcoh by now.

266
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:15,258
Well... Where are they?

267
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:18,158
You do know how to
find them, right?

268
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:20,858
[Ed exhales]

269
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:26,724
[Ed] <i>If I were Al, where
would I go? C'mon... Think.</i>

270
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:34,124
Still awake?

271
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:35,891
[Al gasps]

272
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:39,091
[Al] Yeah, sorry...
it's just a lot...

273
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:42,091
You were a slave and now
you're a Philosopher's Stone?

274
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:44,124
Yeah... Right...

275
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:49,391
Can't say I blame you
if you don't believe me...

276
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:51,224
I doubt I would...

277
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:54,391
I know how impossibly
far-fetched that it sounds...

278
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:56,991
You'd have to be
crazy to believe it.

279
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,924
[Al] Well, I guess
I'm crazy then,

280
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:03,291
because I do believe you.

281
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,324
Do you really? That was fast.

282
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:09,258
[Al] To be honest,
it kind of scares me.

283
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:14,291
And besides, my situation's
kind of far-fetched too.

284
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:17,391
[Hohenheim exhales]

285
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:21,858
[Al] So... What's it like
not being able to die?

286
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:23,858
[Hohenheim]
Well... It's...

287
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:28,024
I'm not gonna lie and say
it doesn't come in handy.

288
00:16:28,024 --> 00:16:32,258
But it's not worth watching
everyone I love die before me.

289
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:35,724
[Al] Like Mom.

290
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,150
[Al] Wait... If you're
a Philosopher's Stone,

291
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,950
you don't have a normal
human body, right...?

292
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,617
So does that mean...
Ed and I...

293
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:52,583
Aren't exactly normal
humans either?

294
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,617
[Al] Yeah.

295
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:55,450
You don't have to worry, Al...

296
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,650
It's true that I have
a Philosopher's Stone

297
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,583
fused to my soul...
but not even that

298
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:04,550
can change the fact that
I am a human being...

299
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,983
Although... My look-alike
beneath Central?

300
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:12,717
His body is like a leather bag
that's patterned after mine.

301
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:14,283
[Al] A leather bag?

302
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,650
[Hohenheim] More or less.

303
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,117
And if we can destroy
that leather bag...

304
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:20,350
then we can defeat
what's inside.

305
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,250
[Al] That makes sense.
Oh, I almost forgot!

306
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,517
Look at this... They're
gonna do the same thing

307
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,383
to Amestris that they did
to Xerxes, aren't they?

308
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:34,417
We've gotta hurry and stop
them. It's almost complete.

309
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,983
[Hohenheim]
Ho, I'm impressed.

310
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:38,250
You've really done
your homework.

311
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,117
This a reverse
transmutation circle, huh?

312
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:43,683
[Al] Destroying the tunnel
seems like the best way

313
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:46,317
to thwart them. And since
it runs under Liore--

314
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,717
[Hohenheim]
That's not a good idea.

315
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:48,917
[Al reacts]

316
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,283
[Hohenheim] They've got an
immensely powerful Homunculus

317
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,650
named Pride watching
over the tunnel.

318
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,117
[Al] But still... We've gotta
try before it's too late.

319
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,650
For all we know, they might have
already completed the circle.

320
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,117
[Al] Then why are
you so relaxed?

321
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:05,683
Because... It's not yet time.

322
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:08,383
[Al] Huh? How do you know?

323
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:11,550
Look up, son... You're
too busy looking down

324
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,983
when you need to look up.

325
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:14,083
[Al] Huh?

326
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,650
If you want answers,
that's where you'll find them.

327
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:22,650
[Al] Up? The sky? You
mean the Sun God Leto?

328
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,383
[Hohenheim] The man
in Central is waiting...

329
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:27,683
for the Day of Reckoning.

330
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:31,617
[Bido pants]

331
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:35,250
Why is he doing this to me?
What did I do to deserve it?

332
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,583
[Bido cries] Yaah!

333
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,150
[Bido grunts]

334
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,483
[Bido wheezes]

335
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:45,517
[Greed laughs]

336
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:47,283
[Greed] Well this is fun...

337
00:18:47,283 --> 00:18:49,483
Most people tend
to curl up and cry.

338
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:52,250
It's about time that someone
actually fights back...

339
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,383
I do appreciate the chance
to kill my boredom.

340
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:58,250
[Greed laughs]

341
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,983
The Ultimate Shield?

342
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:03,283
And your voice sounds
like... What the hell?

343
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:06,250
You... How dare you
imitate Mr. Greed?

344
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:11,317
Excuse me? I'm no
imitation. My name is Greed.

345
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,017
The Avaricious?

346
00:19:13,017 --> 00:19:16,350
You got it... I want everything
you could possibly think of.

347
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,950
I want money and power and
women... sex, status, glory--

348
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,617
You demand the
finer things in life!

349
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:23,650
Huh?

350
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,283
You can't... How could you be?

351
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:28,650
Alright... Who are you?

352
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,483
[Greed grunts]

353
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:32,250
It has to be!
You are Mr. Greed...

354
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,517
But how can you look
like someone else?

355
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:37,450
[Greed] I asked you who
you are, now tell me.

356
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,483
It's me! I'm your friend! Bido!

357
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:43,350
You haven't been gone from
Dublith long enough to forget!

358
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,217
You're from Dublith!
Ohh. Now it makes sense.

359
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:50,517
You remember me?

360
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:54,483
Afraid not... You must've been
buddies with the previous Greed.

361
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:56,250
But... I thought...

362
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,283
Sorry, pal, but you and
I've never even met.

363
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:04,283
[Bido] But Mr. Greed...
I'm your... friend.

364
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,450
[Greed] It's nothing personal,
I'm just doing my job.

365
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,950
I am sorry... Honestly.

366
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,283
[Greed grunts]

367
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,417
What the hell?

368
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,017
[Greed grunts]

369
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:21,450
[Greed gasps]

370
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,217
[Greed exhales]

371
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:28,650
[Greed coughs, wheezes]

372
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,383
[Ling] What have
you done, Greed?

373
00:20:31,383 --> 00:20:34,617
Are you determined to
prove you're a monster?

374
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:39,350
What kind of sick creature...
would kill his own friend?!

375
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,517
He wasn't my... friend.

376
00:20:44,183 --> 00:20:45,583
[Greed growls]

377
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,650
Then why do you
remember him?

378
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,250
And are you gonna
try and tell me

379
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,950
Bido was just making
everything up?

380
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,717
[Greed] Those are the
last Greed's memories...

381
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:55,383
They're not mine!

382
00:20:55,383 --> 00:20:57,650
Then why are you
in so much pain?

383
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,117
[Greed grunts]

384
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:03,983
Pull yourself together,
Greed... I'm warning you...

385
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:06,650
I'll take my body back
if you drop your guard.

386
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,383
They aren't mine.
Father purified me

387
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:11,683
and purged the old
Greed's memories...

388
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:15,717
Those memories aren't
a part of me anymore!

389
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:18,250
No, you're wrong, Greed!

390
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,517
It's not that easy... They'll
always be a part of you!

391
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:24,283
You can't just erase
them from your soul...

392
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,217
They were the only part
of you that you chose!

393
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:32,283
Look at them! Can you not
hear their souls crying out?!

394
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:35,250
You abandoned them!
Your real family!

395
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,583
You threw them away like trash!

396
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:41,417
Fool! If you turned your back
on something you wanted,

397
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,983
you don't deserve to
call yourself Greed!

398
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:50,150
[Greed screams]

399
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:26,350
[Mrs. Bradley] I think
you'll enjoy this one.

400
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,583
I was just a bit older than you
are the first time I read it.

401
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:34,183
It's about an adventurer
who travels the world.

402
00:23:34,183 --> 00:23:35,483
[Selim and Mrs. Bradley gasp]

403
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:37,117
What is it?

404
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:48,983
Who is it?

405
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:53,583
[Greed pants]

406
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:57,683
[Greed yells]

407
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:07,039
[Narrator] <i>Fueled by
