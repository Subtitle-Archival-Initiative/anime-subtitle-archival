his own pockets?

thief was up to,

you two. Nice work...

I appreciate you
resolving the matter.

100
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,176
No big deal.
It's not like we did it for you.

101
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:34,509
[Roy] Right.
The Philosopher's Stone.

102
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,042
Another false lead?

103
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:41,709
Yeah, after all that,
the stone was a fake.

104
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,476
Even so... the power it gave
Cornello was real enough.

105
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,042
He transmuted this huge
chimera right in front of us.

106
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,876
[Al] I still wonder how
he was able to use

107
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:52,576
the stone to do that.
I'm not familiar enough

108
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:55,409
with the field of bio-alchemy
to really understand it.

109
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,509
Yeah, I'm kind of curious
about that to...

110
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,809
It might be worth looking into.
Who knows, maybe we'll find

111
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,742
something that could help
us restore our bodies.

112
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:03,676
[Al] Hmm.

113
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:05,976
It might help if you
consulted a specialist.

114
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:07,142
[Both] Huh?

115
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,909
[Roy] The Sewing Life Alchemist,
Shou Tucker... He's done some

116
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:13,076
heavy research into
chimera transmutation.

117
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:14,076
I'll introduce you.

118
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:16,142
[Al] You would do
that for us?

119
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,642
Okay, what's the catch! You want
something, don't you!

120
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:21,009
[Roy] Don't doubt my motives!
I'm trying to repay you

121
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:22,942
for your work on
the Liore case.

122
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:26,376
Doing you a favor is better
than being indebted to you.

123
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:30,609
<i>[Roy] Two years ago, Tucker
transmuted a chimera that</i>

124
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,876
<i>could understand human
speech. That earned him</i>

125
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,809
<i>his certification as
a State Alchemist.</i>

126
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,876
By "understand human
speech," you mean...

127
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:39,809
Wait, You mean it talks?
A chimera?!

128
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:42,609
Right... supposedly.

129
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:44,609
It only said one thing.

130

There are people
out here! Look.

you to keep the dog tied up.

143
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,404
[Tucker] I'm sorry about
the mess. Ever since my wife

144
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:22,704
ran out, this place
has been a wreck.

145
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:24,838
I'm not much of a housekeeper.

147
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:32,138
Now that we're all settled
in, let me say that it's

148
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:34,738
a pleasure to meet you, Edward.
As the colonel told you,

149
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:36,938
I'm the Sewing Life Alchemist,
Shou Tucker.

150
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:40,104
Ed is interested in the field
of biologic alchemy.

151
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:41,738
He would like to have a
look at your research

152
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:42,938
if that's possible.

153
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:45,138
Oh yes, certainly,
I don't mind.

If you want me to show you the
tricks I've got up my sleeve,

157
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,838
it's only fair that
you show me the tricks

158
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,671
you've got up yours as well.

159
00:07:54,671 --> 00:07:57,238
[Tucker] It's the code we
live by--equivalent exchange.

160
00:07:57,238 --> 00:08:00,738
Now. Why are you
interested in bio-alchemy?

161
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:03,071
Oh, um... Ed...
Well, you see, he's--

162
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,171

...as an eleven-year-old child?

166
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:15,738
[Tucker] I see...
So that's what earned you

167
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:18,138
the title 'Fullmetal Alchemist.'

168
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:21,004
You've had a rough time
of it for someone so young.

169
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,804
I can't say for sure
if it's going to be

170
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:30,004
of any use to
you or not...

171
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:32,738

But why don't you go ahead and
take a look at my laboratory.

00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:08,825
[Ed] Oh yeah, I figured
it out. You did it again!

349
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:10,925
Two years ago,
it was your wife!

350
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,925
This time you used your
own daughter and her dog

351
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:15,925
to transmute a talking chimera!

352
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:19,059
You can only do so much
with animals, after all.

353
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:22,359
It's much easier when you start
with a human, isn't that right?!

354
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,259
I don't see what you're
so upset about...

355
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:27,325
This is how we progress.

356
00:17:27,325 --> 00:17:30,525
Human experimentation
is a necessary step.

357
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,059
I would think a scientist
should understand.

358
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,059
[Ed] Shut up!

359
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,792
Do you really think you
can get away with this?!

360
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:39,092
Messing around with
someone's life like that?

361
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,959
Your own daughter?!

362
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,392
Someone's life, you say?

363
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:45,925
Ha ha. You'd know all
about that, wouldn't you?

364
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:47,892
Look at you,
Fullmetal Alchemist...

365
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,925
Look at your leg,
your arm, your brother!

366
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:53,459
Those things are also the
result of messing around

367
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:56,059
with somebody's
life, aren't they?

368
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,092
[Ed] Shut up!

369
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:02,059
[laughing]
We are the same!

370
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,092
We're the same...
you're just like me!

371
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:05,092
We're not!

372
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,792
Oh, but yes we are...

373
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:09,192
The opportunity was right in
front of us, and we took it!

374
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:12,292
We had to, even though we knew
it was against the rules.

375
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,325
No!

376
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,025
Not me!

377
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,059
Alchemists don't...

378
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:19,959
...do that!

379
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:23,792
I'm not... I'm not!

380
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,192
[Al] Brother!

381
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:27,959
If you keep this up, he'll die.

382
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,492
Edward... No.

383
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:46,425
Daddy, do you... hurt? Daddy?

384
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:55,992
[Al] I'm sorry.
Even with all our power,

385
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:59,859
we can't do anything
to change you back.

386
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:03,159
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

387
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,325
Can we play... now?
Can we play now?

388
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:09,559
I made it just in time...

389
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,092
I get to remain a State
Alchemist. I passed!

390
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:28,859
[Ed]
Like hell, you're staying a
State Alchemist! Like hell!

391
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,359
Can we... play now?

392
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,259
[Ed screams]

393
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:40,992
[rain falling]

394
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,059
<i>[Hawkeye] If ever there was
an example of the devil's</i>

395
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,059
<i>work in this world, this case
would definitely be it.</i>

396
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,192
<i>[Roy] The devil, huh?</i>

397
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:52,925
<i>A State Alchemist
must be willing to act,</i>

398
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,925
able to take another's life when
ordered to without questioning.

399
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:58,159
<i>In some ways,</i>

400
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,325
Mr. Tucker's actions and our own
may not be all that far apart,

401
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:05,292
<i>when it comes to interfering
with other people's lives.</i>

402
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:08,925
We choose our own path, knowing
full well what we're doing.

403
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,359
That's the way it is...
Right, Fullmetal?

404
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:21,059
You will more than
likely come across cases

405
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,325
like this again
in the future...

406
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:26,792
And you may end up having to get
your own hands dirty, as well.

407
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,959
Are you going to shut down
like this every time?

408
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:32,325
[Ed] We may be called
dogs of the military...

409
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:35,992
We may even be cursed as
devils... It doesn't matter.

410
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:39,025
Al and I are still going
to get our bodies back.

411
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:43,392
We know the truth.
We know we're not devils.

412
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:46,559
We know we're not gods!

413
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,225
We're human.

414
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:52,859
[shouting]
We're only human!

415
00:20:55,325 --> 00:20:58,759
We can't even do anything to
save one innocent little girl.

416
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,225
[Ed] So what good are we, then?

417
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:08,459
I wonder why no one's
capable of understanding me.

418
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,492
Nina.

419
00:21:11,092 --> 00:21:13,092

[thunder]

421
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,392
You're Shou Tucker, correct?

422
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:21,492
Who are you?
Not military...

423
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:23,392
Who are you?!

424
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:24,825
How did you get in here?

425
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,792
There were military
police out front!

426
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,925
Foolish alchemists
who turn their backs

427
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:31,492
on the ways of God...

428
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,492
...shall be punished.

429
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,759
Daddy's hurting.

430
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:52,392
Daddy hurts... No, Daddy.

431
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:55,359
You poor creature. Once you
have been given this form,

432
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,059
there is no way of
separating you again.

433
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:02,459
At least...
Your passing will be in peace.

434
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:04,092

435
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,092
[Scar] God...

436
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:15,392
Hear me... Two human souls
have just been returned to you.

437
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:18,325
Please accept them
into your loving arms.

438
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:20,792
Please grant these
poor, lost souls

439
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:23,159
everlasting peace
and salvation.
