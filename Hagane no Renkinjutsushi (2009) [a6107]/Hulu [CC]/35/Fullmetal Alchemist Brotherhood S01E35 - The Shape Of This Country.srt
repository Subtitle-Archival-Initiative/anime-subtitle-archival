1
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,286
Now you get to see
the "Briggs way," kid.

2
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:41,220
Uh, "the Briggs way"?

3
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,386
That's right.

4
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:45,420
Come, alchemist...
gimme a hand.

5
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,353
[Ed yelps]

6
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:47,286
[Al] Brother!

7
00:01:47,286 --> 00:01:48,986
You, too, tin man!

8
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:51,986
Hey, hold on! We can't just--

9
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,353
You were forced to
help us under duress...

10
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:57,420
How does that
excuse work for you?

11
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,453
Hmm? Who's this?

12
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,353
He's an old friend of ours.

13
00:02:01,353 --> 00:02:02,986
Ah... Then he'll help too.

14
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:04,453
Huh?!

15
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:06,520
[Buccaneer]
Hurry! Don't spill any!

16
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,686
[Miles] Buccaneer...
Head for Gate 8!

17
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:10,286
Sir!

18
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,320
[Olivier] Let's move!
Drive it into the elevator!

19
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,053
[Sloth groans]

20
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:27,520
[Sloth struggles]

21
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,320
What... a pain...

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,486
Move it! Push us!

23
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,286
Good! It's working!
Rotate... turret right!

24
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,220
Yes... sir!

25
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,553
Do it, Miles! Close it!

26
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,186
Sir!

27
00:02:52,686 --> 00:02:55,520
Uh...

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,486
Yes! It's gone!

29
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,453
Uh, where... am I?

30
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:10,286
[Buccaneer growls]

31
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:11,720
Ehh?

32
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,353
Rryaaahhh!

33
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:17,486
All right! Do it now!

34
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,986
Huh?

35
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:25,286
Nice!

36
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:27,020
[Al] Okay... What next?

37
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,320
[Ed] Yeah, how were
you planning to get

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,020
this big guy through
the gate, exactly?

39
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,453
[Sloth]
Stink.

40
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:37,586
[Ed and Al gasp]

41
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,553
Move it, you little runt!

42
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:50,553
Uh...?

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,053
Uhh...

44
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,520
Hey! One more!

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,586
We're out of ammo!

46
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:02,286
Well, in that case...

47
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,553
Hey... ow.

48
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:10,220
[Ed and Al yell]

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,286
Nice!

50
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:20,720
[Buccaneer] That fuel is
specially blended for the cold.

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,453
It'll vaporize
almost instantly...

52
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:27,386
and as it evaporates,
it will sap his body heat.

53
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:29,153
This blizzard will help, too...

54
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:33,020
It'll freeze him,
right down to his brain.

55
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,520
[Sloth]
It's so... cold...

56
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,353
Body... won't... move...

57
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:52,620
What... a pain.

58
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:03,186
You can sleep there
until spring, monster...

59
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:06,220
Alright, Buccaneer.
Now take these two away.

60
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,686
Sir!

61
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:08,453
Huh?!

62
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,120
[Ed] Hey hey, hold on a second!

63
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,420
We helped you! Why are
you doing this? How can--

64
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,520
[Olivier] You were forced to.

65
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,553
That was just the excuse
you needed to fight, right?

66
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:19,353
Besides which, I'm not
letting you go anywhere

67
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,353
until you explain
exactly what that thing was

68
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,186
and what it wanted.

69
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,353
[Ed yawns, shivers]

70
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:33,286
It's so cold.

71
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:36,686
[Ed] Restraints?

72
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:39,620
[Al] Good morning...
Nice chains.

73
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,186
Yeah... they're just lovely.

74
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:45,320
[Neil] Hey...
you two sleep well?

75
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,586
[Ed] I guess, considering...

76
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,686
[Neil laughs]

77
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:50,853
[Ed] Hm?

78
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:53,720
I heard you helped defend
the fort from that monster.

79
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,520
[Ed] Thank you.

80
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,053
That's a hundred cens.

81
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,286
You're charging me for this?!

82
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:02,420
[Al] So... find
anything else out?

83
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,220
We sent a party down
to investigate the hole.

84
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,686
They should be
back anytime now.

85
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:10,586
Also, Major Miles
is at the hospital.

86
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,186
Is he hurt?

87
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,120
Hardly. He's there
visiting a soldier

88
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,186
who was wounded fighting Scar.

89
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,486
Scar's in the north now?

90
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:19,686
[Soldier 4]
Oh, here they are.

91
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:20,686
[Ed] Hm?

92
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:21,953
[Soldier 5]
They're awake.

93
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:23,020
[Soldier 6]
Thanks for yesterday.

94
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,686
[Soldier 7] Yeah... You
saved our buddies' lives.

95
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,386
I'm impressed. You
guys stick together.

96
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:31,286
You really seem to care.

97
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:33,586
Well, here at Briggs, we have
to look out for each other.

98
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:35,020
You saved our pals back there,

99
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,686
so that makes you
our pal as well.

100
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:38,686
Well, you want to let your
pal out of here, then?

101
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:42,286
No, we're not allowed
to do that, sorry.

102
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:44,586
It was worth a try, I guess.

103
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,520
[Miles] Apparently they
didn't find any sign

104
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,586
of Scar's body at the site.

105
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:53,186
He could always be holed up
somewhere nearby, though.

106
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:54,553
That's true.

107
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:55,686
[Miles] <i>Interesting...</i>

108
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:58,486
<i>First a search for a
strange black-and-white cat,</i>

109
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:01,286
<i>then a search for Scar.</i>

110
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:03,286
[Miles] All right.

111
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:05,153
You can leave Scar to us

112
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:07,186
and focus on getting better.

113
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:08,686
Hold on a sec.

114
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:11,586
I want you and your
people to stay out of this.

115
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,953
The Ishvalan is
mine to hunt down.

116
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,253
[Miles]
I hate to tell you this,

117
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,020
but the soldiers
of Briggs won't let

118
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,420
a serial killer
roam around free.

119
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,286
Here in the north, the law
is survival of the fittest.

120
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:26,353
[Kimblee gasps]

121
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:30,153
You get careless, and you
get dead. Understand?

122
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:31,553
You tell me what to do again,

123
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:34,286
and you'll never
leave this hospital.

124
00:07:35,686 --> 00:07:38,420
This case is ours now.
The Briggs branch will

125
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,953
take care of everything.
You behave yourself.

126
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:46,520
[Kimblee laughs]

127
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,153
Another Ishvalan.
That's interesting.

128
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,286
Hm?

129
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:56,586
Hello, Kimblee. And
how are you recovering?

130
00:07:56,586 --> 00:08:00,353
Well, hello, General Raven.
You got here quickly.

131
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:02,986
I heard the news and
came as fast as I could.

132
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:05,420
I was worried about you.

133
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,986
These are what you're
really worried about.

134
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,953
Isn't that right?

135
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:15,686
Very good... Now,
we have work to do.

136
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:19,620
I'm not exactly in great
shape at the moment.

137
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,686
No problem. I brought a
doctor who knows alchemy.

138
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:25,020
And we have the
stones, as well.

139
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,186
You'll be fine in no time.

140
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:30,986
[Doctor laughs]

141
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:36,953
[Marcoh groans]

142
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:40,420
Alkahestry seems to
be pretty complicated.

143
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,020
This "dragon pulse" business
is especially confusing.

144
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,486
It's about the chi of the land.

145
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:49,320
What do you mean by the "chi"?

146
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,020
I'll try to explain.

147
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,720
Basically, it's an
energy that exists

148
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,520
in all things in this world,

149
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,220
like rivers of power
flowing through it.

150
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,686
Those rivers are far-reaching.

151
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:01,153
They touch everybody
and everything.

152
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:03,020
All you have to
do is understand

153
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,953
how that power flows,
from where it enters,

154
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:06,920
and where it leaves...

155
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:13,553
And then you can use it to
affect just about anything.

156
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,720
Just about anything.
So... the body, too?

157
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,420
Yes!

158
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,686
It could be... your back!

159
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:23,486
[Marcoh]
Oww... my leg!

160
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:25,320
Or else... your neck!

161
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,386
[Marco screams]

162
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:30,020
Why did my eyeballs hurt
when you pressed my neck?

163
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,953
[May] Dr. Marcoh,
you should take

164
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:33,020
better care of yourself...

165
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,020
All the power in your body
is starting to stagnate.

166
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,420
Uh... So, that's it, is it?

167
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,586
The theory behind your
"remote transmutation"...

168
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,320
[May] Then, alchemists don't
use the dragon's pulse?

169
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,086
They do not. They use energy

170
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:50,353
from the movement
of the earth's crust.

171
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:53,020
A great deal of energy
is created, then released

172
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,553
during earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions.

173
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,553
That's what fuels our
alchemy in this country.

174
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:01,620
I don't know...
That doesn't seem right.

175
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,020
Hm?

176
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,686
I've felt that
something was out of place

177
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:08,020
ever since I got here...
I noticed it especially

178
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,320
when we were under
Central. I can tell

179
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,420
that there's energy
flowing under my feet...

180
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,953
But it doesn't feel like

181
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:17,453
it comes from the
land's movement...

182
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,153
It feels like...

183
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,532
a crowd of people...
squirming around.

184
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:28,153
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

185
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:34,342
[Narrator]
<i>Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

186
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:39,109
[Soldier] It's huge.
A platoon could fit

187
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:41,709
through the hole...
It curves gently

188
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,209
and then continues
on for a long way.

189
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:48,642
But there were no
signs of anyone in it.

190
00:10:48,642 --> 00:10:50,209
Lower some horses...

191
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,142
[Buccaneer] Yes sir!

192
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:53,409
...and I want to see
the Elric brothers.

193
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:00,809
[Ed] Awesome... this
is a serious tunnel.

194
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:03,109
I still can't believe
that an intruder was

195
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:05,509
able to get this far
through our defenses.

196
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,509
So has anyone else ever
made it into the fort before?

197
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:11,242
No, not in all the time
I've had command here.

198
00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:13,209
But once, nearly
twenty years ago,

199
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,275
there was a strange incident
where the Mountain Guard

200
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,509
was attacked in
the middle of winter.

201
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,242
Apparently, a mysterious woman

202
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:22,775
stole food and supplies
for a full month.

203
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:24,642
[Izumi] I survived
for a whole month

204
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,375
in the Briggs Mountains!

205
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,409
[Ed and Al ]
<i>It was Teacher!</i>

206
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:32,542
This should be far enough.

207
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:33,775
You. Dismount.

208
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:35,409
[Ed] Hm?

209
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:37,375
[Olivier] Now then...

210
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,642
We're safely away
from any prying eyes.

211
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:43,742
You can tell me everything
without fearing discovery.

212
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:46,409
And I mean everything.

213
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,509
Don't hold anything back.

214
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:51,209
Yesterday I asked you
about that monster.

215
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,342
Remember what you said?
"I can't answer."

216
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:57,042
You refused me...

217
00:11:57,042 --> 00:12:00,242
And that, even as a hint,
is a dangerous thing to do.

218
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:03,209
I told you to answer my
questions fully and completely.

219
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:06,242
At great peril to yourself,
you neglected to do so.

220
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:08,175
I think there's something
you're trying to hide.

221
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:10,309
And you'd risk your
lives to protect it.

222
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:12,642
Something, or maybe someone.

223
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:17,509
This time, don't lie to me.

224
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:19,542
I want the truth.

225
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,075
We need your help, General.

226
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:31,242
[Olivier]
The Philosopher's Stone.

227
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:35,275
Homunculi.
Fuhrer King Bradley.

228
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,809
A mysterious man called Father.

229
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,709
Corruption in the senior staff.

230
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,542
There are hostages
involved, as well.

231
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,775
Your childhood friend
the automail engineer

232
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:47,175
and all Mustang's men...

233
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:48,209
We've done some joint training

234
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:51,075
with Eastern Command
over the years, so I know

235
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:53,042
officers Hawkeye and Havoc,

236
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:55,742
and I'd hate it if we
lost either of them.

237
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,642
I would like to help them.

238
00:12:57,642 --> 00:13:01,309
And, um... what about
Colonel Mustang?

239
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:04,775
Yeah... I couldn't
care less about him.

240
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,109
I'd just as soon see
him fall from power.

241
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:10,242
That would
eliminate another rival.

242
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:11,342
Never mind him.

243
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:13,642
The question is,
what do we do next?

244
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:15,509
This tunnel here.
I would like to know

245
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,775
what you alchemists make of it.

246
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:28,509
[Ed] First of all, the
tunnel probably didn't

247
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:32,742
originate in Drachma...
This is just my guess...

248
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:35,042
but I'd say chances
are we'll find it's dug

249
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:37,075
in the shape of
an enormous circle.

250
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:38,442
Why?

251
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,642
It has to do with alchemy.
In our field, a circle

252
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:44,342
is the symbol used
to control power.

253
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:47,142
We need to look at
this more closely.

254
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,075
[Ed] Lieutenant Falman.

255
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:52,209
Can you list the major
events in Amestris

256
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:54,275
that were accompanied
by bloodshed?

257
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:56,175
By bloodshed?

258
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:59,475
[Falman] What are
you getting at?

259
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:04,342
[Falman gasps]

260
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:08,275
First, there's
July, 1588. In Riviere.

261
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:11,542
Okay, Riviere. Next.

262
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:16,442
[Falman] October, 1661.
The Cameron Uprising.

263
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:20,375
February, 1799.
The Soapman Incident.

264
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,309
There, in Fisk.

265
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:26,709
March, 1811.
The Wellesley Incident.

266
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:30,709
October, 1835. The first
Southern Border War,

267
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,375
in what is now
known as South City.

268
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,209
Then, in 1911, there was

269
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,609
the Second Southern
Border War in Fotosett.

270
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:41,809
[Ed] What about
Pendleton, in the west?

271
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:43,675
[Falman] There's been
fighting with Creta.

272
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,742
A lot of soldiers
have died. And then...

273
00:14:46,742 --> 00:14:50,242
Later, in 1914, there was
the Liore Insurrection.

274
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:51,775
There were many casualties.

275
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,242
What?

276
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,375
[Al] An insurrection? But why?

277
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,375
I don't understand. I exposed
the fake priest in Liore.

278
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,475
And I reported it to Eastern
Command immediately.

279
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:05,042
Yes, you did... but the
Central forces came in

280
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:07,142
and ran out the
troops from the east.

281
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:10,442
After that happened,
Liore just fell to pieces.

282
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,475
Oh, no... damn!

283
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:15,342
[Olivier] No time for that.
Back to work, Fullmetal.

284
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,475
All right. Fine.

285
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:25,009
And now... we just
connect the dots.

286
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:27,609
[Olivier gasps]

287
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:30,642
How is that possible?
It... It looks like

288
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:34,275
the transmutation circle
from the Fifth Laboratory!

289
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:36,309
Is that so? The
Philosopher's Stone array

290
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:39,275
that draws power
from human lives.

291
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:40,442
[Buccaneer] If they make
a Philosopher's Stone

292
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:41,575
with something this huge,

293
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:44,509
how many people
will have to die?

294
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,642
[Marcoh] Once I asked
Envy if the Homunculi

295
00:15:46,642 --> 00:15:48,275
were planning to
use this country

296
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,675
to create a
Philosopher's Stone.

297
00:15:50,675 --> 00:15:53,142
But he just laughed
at my question.

298
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:56,775
Then he said no, that
was not it... but close.

299
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:59,575
Earlier, I had spoken
to Edward Elric.

300
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,742
I told him that maybe
he would be able

301
00:16:01,742 --> 00:16:05,309
to find the truth
hidden within the truth.

302
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:07,509
Three truths: first,
that the ingredients

303
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,509
for a Philosopher's
Stone are live humans.

304
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,475
Second, that there
is a group of beings

305
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:15,109
seeking to create
an enormous stone.

306
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:18,242
And third, that they plan
to use the entire country

307
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:21,275
as a transmutation
circle to make it.

308
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,775
But even all that doesn't
explain everything.

309
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,675
Ultimately, what
is their motive?

310
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:28,375
What is it they're
really trying to do?

311
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,442
I know you're seeking
the secrets of immortality.

312
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:33,075
But you can't let your search

313
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,542
lead you to the
Philosopher's Stone...

314
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,475
By combining the
information I have

315
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:39,509
with your knowledge
of alkahestry, we'll

316
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:42,642
figure out these notes
somehow, I'm sure of it.

317
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:44,175
[May] Right!

318
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:46,642
Hmm...

319
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,509
The first of the conflicts
happened in 1558.

320
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,642
Right. It was just after
the founding of Amestris.

321
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:56,542
They attacked Riviere...

322
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,309
That was the neighboring
country at the time.

323
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:02,075
And then the military--
Hey... Wait...

324
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:04,642
That's it!

325
00:17:04,642 --> 00:17:06,042
It was the military!

326
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,642
They were involved
in all of it!

327
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:08,842
[several gasps]

328
00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:11,575
[Falman] Each incident was a
coup d'etat or insurrection.

329
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:14,675
Like in Liore. Forces from
Central would be sent in,

330
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:16,575
and they would make
everything worse.

331
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:19,409
It's been going on that long?

332
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,742
We kept growing...
Our country started out

333
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:24,109
as a small nation,
but we expanded

334
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,809
as we took over more and
more neighboring countries.

335
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:30,575
That was all to
create this circle?

336
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:33,242
So that means... not only
are they planning to use

337
00:17:33,242 --> 00:17:36,109
this country to do whatever
it is they're doing...

338
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:38,042
but they actually created
it in the first place

339
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:40,742
for that single purpose.

340
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:43,142
My country...

341
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:47,509
[Al] Do you think...
General Hughes...?

342
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:50,075
Yeah... before
he was killed...

343
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:52,575
he must've seen the
transmutation circle.

344
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:55,242
He was serving in the
court-martial office.

345
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,175
He had all the information
about the military incidents.

346
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:00,275
He would've known that
something wasn't right.

347
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:02,542
That must be why--

348
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,242
[Isaac] You've sworn
your life to the state

349
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:06,575
as a Dog of the Military...

350
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:08,642
But do you really know
the ones you serve?

351
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:09,809
Or what their true plans are?

352
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:12,642
You get a speck of power...
and you have the arrogance

353
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:15,442
to assume you're the one
who's in control of it.

354
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:17,542
Don't be a fool!
He'll lead us all to ruin!

355
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:20,042
I'm only doing what
needs to be done!

356
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,809
[Ed gasps]

357
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,509
I do not like this!

358
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:27,775
As far as I can tell,
there's only one place left.

359
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:30,109
If you're right about
your theory, the next place

360
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,509
they're going to hit is
right here in Briggs...

361
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:34,242
Those bastards in Central...

362
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:37,242
What kind of dirty plans
do they have for my fort?!

363
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,642
[Soldier 9]
General! You're needed

364
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:41,109
back at the fort.
Lieutenant General Raven

365
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:43,175
from Central is
here to see you.

366
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:48,309
It looks like our
time's already up.

367
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,242
Excuse me, General Armstrong.

368
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,542
I'd like to ask
a favor of you.

369
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:55,242
[Olivier gasps]

370
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:56,109
Do you think you could con

371
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:59,275
some information
out of General Raven?

372
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,378
[Miles]
General Raven, sir.

373
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,045
I'm terribly sorry to
have to ask you to wait.

374
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:11,212
No, please don't
worry about it.

375
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:13,512
It's my fault for
dropping in like this.

376
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:16,878
General Armstrong should
return at any moment now.

377
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:17,678
This way... please.

378
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:19,245
[Raven] Oh, and...
As you can see,

379
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,612
I've brought a guest with me...

380
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:22,378
If it's not too much trouble...

381
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:23,545
then perhaps you
would be so kind

382
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:26,312
as to show him
around the fort.

383
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:29,945
I'd appreciate it
Thanks, Major Miles.

384
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:38,578
[Al] Winry's apple pie.

385
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,545
That was the first
thing I wanted to do

386
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:43,945
when I got my body
back... But now...

387
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:47,045
even that much may be
out of reach forever.

388
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:50,578
You'll have all the apple
pie you could ever want.

389
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:52,578
We're going to get
our bodies back!

390
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,245
And the monsters who
have been messing with

391
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:57,045
our country for all this
time are going to pay!

392
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:58,845
Just you wait!

393
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:03,245
[Olivier] I apologize
for the chaos, sir.

394
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,545
We were attacked yesterday.

395
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:07,278
[Raven] By whom?

396
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:08,445
[Olivier] I think it's
most appropriate

397
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,978
to call it a monster...
but fortunately,

398
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:12,445
we were able to fend it off.

399
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:16,045
A monster? What do you mean?

400
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:18,345
We killed it,
but it didn't die, sir.

401
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:20,912
[Raven laughs]

402
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:22,478
Is that so?

403
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:27,945
[Olivier] I suspected that
it originated in Drachma...

404
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:31,045
but the Elric brothers...

405
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:33,512
Didn't I mention?
The Fullmetal Alchemist

406
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:36,045
and his brother are here.

407
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:37,412
I found it disturbing...

408
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:40,212
They seemed to know
about this monster...

409
00:20:40,212 --> 00:20:42,312
but they wouldn't talk.

410
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:44,445
Obviously, if we
have a State Alchemist

411
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:46,912
doubling as a spy for Drachma,

412
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,445
that's a serious problem.
I've locked them up.

413
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:52,445
Perhaps you'd like
to speak with them?

414
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:55,445
[Raven]
Hmm... Certainly...

415
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:57,212
They won't tell you anything?

416
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,445
[Olivier] Correct.
They said they came here

417
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:02,578
to research living
transmutation or something.

418
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:07,012
What could be more suspicious?
I distrusted them instantly.

419
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:14,245
I had thought about torturing
them to get the information...

420
00:21:14,245 --> 00:21:16,612
But I am a woman, after all...

421
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:19,378
The thought of
hurting those boys...

422
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,445
Let's just say I
couldn't stand it.

423
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:23,845
Now, that's rich...
She would've tortured you

424
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:26,045
in a second and not
thought twice about it.

425
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:27,612
[Raven laughs]

426
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:29,478
But General Armstrong,
aren't you known

427
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:31,578
as the "Northern
Wall of Briggs"?

428
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:33,312
Walls aren't so soft as that.

429
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,578
[Olivier chuckles]

430
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:37,178
You know General Raven,
at my age, most women

431
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:40,045
are expected to have had
a child or two at least.

432
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,878
Unfortunately, I'm
well past that now.

433
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:44,945
[Raven] Come now,
surely men are lining up

434
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:46,312
to have children with you.

435
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:48,178
[Olivier] Hardly, sir.

436
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:50,378
I hate to say... but
like everybody else,

437
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:54,045
I'm growing older...
And my body is too.

438
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:56,045
[Ed and Al exhale]

439
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:58,345
[Olivier] That Drachman
monster, though...

440
00:21:58,345 --> 00:22:01,378
it had an outstanding body.

441
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:06,345
An immortal body. Like
something from a dream.

442
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:11,445
[Raven] What if I told
you that very soon,

443
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:13,612
it wouldn't be a dream anymore?

444
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:15,212
[Ed and Al gasp]

445
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:24,012
[Raven] Tell me, General...

446
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:28,312
Would you be interested in a
legion of immortal soldiers?

447
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:30,912
[Ed and Al]
<i>He took the bait!</i>

448
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:07,233
[Narrator] <i>In the north,
only the strong survive...</i>

449
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:09,533
<i>Either you have
power or you do not...</i>

450
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:14,133
<i>If you have it, you may live.
If not, your chances dwindle.</i>

451
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,566
<i>Because there will always
come a time when power</i>

452
00:24:16,566 --> 00:24:20,133
<i>must be fought with
an even greater power.</i>

453
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:24,133
<i>Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.</i>

454
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:28,599
<i>Episode 36... Family Portrait.</i>

455
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:32,599
<i>A man sets forth, with
resolution in his heart.</i>
