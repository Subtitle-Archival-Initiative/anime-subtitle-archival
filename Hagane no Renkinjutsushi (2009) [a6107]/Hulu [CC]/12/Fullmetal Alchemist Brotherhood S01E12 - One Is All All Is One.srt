Heh... I sure did.

But then that
got me thinking...

250
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:38,321
If I hadn't eaten them,
I might've died...

251

been eaten by them.

this whole island was

354
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:52,121
that you and I can't
even imagine them.

355
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:53,721
You have to
understand that flow...

356
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:56,588
deconstruct it,
and then reconstruct it.

357
00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:58,755
[AL] That's what
alchemy is, Brother.

358
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:02,655
[ED] You're right...
but it's also what living is.

359
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,388
So the basis
of alchemy...

360
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:06,588
deconstruction and
then reconstruction...

361
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:09,388
is just like the food
chain then, isn't it?

362
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:10,288
Like when you
eat a rabbit

363
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,088
and your body breaks
down its flesh...

364
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:14,755
then it's restructured
as a part of yourself...

365
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:15,921
And even before that...

366
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:17,855
the rabbit restructured
the grass it ate

367
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:20,388
into a part of its own body.

368
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:22,688
Alchemy is part of that flow...

369
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:25,655
and the flow is life itself.

370
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:09,455
[NARRATOR]
His name is Greed,

371
00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:11,888
and he revels in his
own sinister desires,

372
00:24:11,888 --> 00:24:14,955
running everything in his
path with cruel cunning.

373
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,988
Now he stands before Ed and Al,

374
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,855
an intimidating figure
in all his grotesque glory,

375
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:22,021
as if he were made for battle.

376
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:26,121
Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood.

377
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:29,821
Episode 13... Beasts of Dublith.

378
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:33,721
This mighty beast is not
to be to looked upon

379
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:35,421
by the faint of heart.
