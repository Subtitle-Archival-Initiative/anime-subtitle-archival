1
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:45,605
[Douglas] This is the bullet

2
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,439
that killed Brigadier
General Hughes.

3
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,439
It's a forty-five caliber...

4
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,105
The killer used only
this one bullet...

5
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:56,672
I'd say it was a good shot,
but it was at point-blank range.

6
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:59,972
Close enough that even a poor
shot could have done it.

7
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:02,605
Now tell me,

8
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:05,539
what is the caliber
of the gun that you carry?

9
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:08,372
It's a-- a forty-five, sir.

10
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:10,572
Here we have a copy
of your requisition form

11
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:12,205
for additional ammunition.

12
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:14,439
Does this look correct?

13
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:18,705
It says here you fired
exactly one shot...

14
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,172
What was that round used for?

15
00:02:21,172 --> 00:02:23,305
It lists the reason right
there on the form...

16
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:25,605
I fired my weapon in
defense of Edward Elric

17
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,939
while in the Fifth Laboratory.

18
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:32,572
But the Fifth Laboratory
is no longer operational...

19
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:34,072
It remains unmanned.

20
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:36,172
It was definitely not unmanned.

21
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:39,205
Sure... according
to your account.

22
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:42,572
Shall I send someone
to search for this bullet

23
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:44,172
you say you fired?

24
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:46,705
There was an unexplained
explosion at the site.

25
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:50,172
The Fifth Laboratory
is now a pile of rubble.

26
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,072
So the place where you claim

27
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:53,405
to have used your
gun was unmanned...

28
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:55,139
and if we looked
for the bullet...

29
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,972
all that we would be able
to find is a pile of rubble...

30
00:02:57,972 --> 00:02:59,672
Is that what you're saying?

31
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:04,505
But, Lieutenant, we have
eyewitness testimony...

32
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:06,972
You were spotted leaving the
scene on the day of the murder,

33
00:03:06,972 --> 00:03:08,705
at the same time
as the shooting.

34
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,139
That's impossible!

35
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,439
Calm down, Lieutenant.

36
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,172
Fine then. So what were
you doing at that time?

37
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:19,572
I had the day off... I was at
my parents' house, visiting...

38
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:23,272
Please, check with them...
They'll tell you.

39
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:26,472
All you can offer us
is your family's testimony?

40
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,339
That is not admissible
as an alibi!

41
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:34,439
Second Lieutenant Ross
is being questioned...

42
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,105
No one is permitted
inside to see her.

43
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:38,972
I see.

44
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:45,105
Major Armstrong!

45
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:47,039
Sergeant Brosh...

46
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,105
I'm glad to see you here, Major.

47
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,305
Is this about Second
Lieutenant Ross?

48
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:53,539
Yes, that's right, sir.

49
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:56,039
Major, I can
corroborate her story.

50
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,572
Lieutenant Ross and I <i>both</i>
fired a round from our weapons

51
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,305
at the Fifth Laboratory
to defend the Elric brothers.

52
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:02,239
You did?

53
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,705
Yes, and it's all
written in my report...

54
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:07,139
but everyone's
ignoring it, sir.

55
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:12,572
<i>Are they trying to frame
the Second Lieutenant for this?</i>

56
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:29,172
When you look close, you're
all scratched up, aren't you?

57
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:31,939
You're having a rough
time of it, huh?

58
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:40,005
So, what have you
got planned now?

59
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:44,372
Well, Ed?

60
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:52,472
What are we gonna do?

61
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:56,472
[Elicia] Mommy...
please don't cry.

62
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,372
What do you think?

63
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,439
What's with the face?

64
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,072
I'm just surprised...

65
00:05:14,072 --> 00:05:17,172
You've never asked
for my advice before.

66
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:20,672
[Ed] Oh.

67
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:29,139
I'm scared, you know.

68
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:31,039
You and Al have been
off somewhere fighting

69
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,139
and digging up information...

70
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,472
Information that could get
you killed like Mr. Hughes.

71
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:40,572
Whenever I think about
that... it terrifies me.

72
00:05:43,372 --> 00:05:45,305
I mean, you could die...

73
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:48,239
I'd still be here,
and you'd just suddenly...

74
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:51,439
not be there anymore.

75
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,005
Like my mom and dad.

76
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,305
It's almost more
than I can handle...

77
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,272
thinking about that...

78
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:02,705
Honestly, sometimes I wish

79
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:05,439
you would just give
this whole thing up.

80
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:11,039
I do want you to get
your bodies back...

81
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,205
but I also want you
to stay alive and safe...

82
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:17,172
It's just...

83
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:19,072
I don't know...

84
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:26,072
Sorry.

85
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:28,439
I'm not sure what
I think you should do...

86
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,939
I really don't know.

87
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:34,572
You're sure being nice, Winry.

88
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:37,272
Why do you sound so
surprised? I'm always nice!

89
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,105
[Al] Hey! Stop it!

90
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:39,705
You take that back,
Alphonse Elric.

91
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:40,872
[Al] You're going
to add more scratches!

92
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:43,039
You take it back right now,
or else! Do you hear me!?

93
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,472
[Al] I'm already
dinged up enough!

94
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:50,405
[66] Your move.

95
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:53,205
[Newspaper Guy] Evening edition!

96
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,172
Oh, it's here! Excellent!

97
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:58,572
[66] What?
The newspaper? Again?

98
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:01,172
[Lt. Falman] I'm stuck here
babysitting you all day.

99
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,172
This is the only
entertainment I get.

100
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:10,539
Lieutenant Falman,
calling on an outside line.

101
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,039
Please connect me
to Colonel Mustang...

102
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,739
Yes, that's right...
My code is--

103
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,539
[66] What's got you so excited?

104
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:22,239
...Airam, George, Oliver...
Four, six, four, nine.

105
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:25,339
This is that lady
from the laboratory.

106
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:33,634
[Ed] The Philosopher's Stone...

107
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:37,834
<i>The people with
the Uroboros tattoos...</i>

108
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,768
<i>The Homunculi...</i>

109
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:42,934
<i>How are they--?</i>

110
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:44,815
Brother!

111
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:45,782
Here.

112
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,948
Don't scare me like that.

113
00:07:47,948 --> 00:07:51,782
The newspaper, Ed...
Read the front page!

114
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:53,815
What is it now?

115
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:58,415
What?!

116
00:07:58,415 --> 00:07:59,915
"Second Lieutenant Maria Ross

117
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:03,582
convicted of Brigadier
General Hughes' murder"?!

118
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:07,348
[Al] I can't believe this!

119
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:08,682
[Ed] Maybe the
colonel or the major

120
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:10,715
will know something about this.

121
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:11,948
What about Winry?

122
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:14,415
We'll explain it to her later.

123
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:19,515
I'm not really a fan of these.

124
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:22,882
Quit your complaining...
Every stray mutt needs a collar.

125
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:25,015
All right, I'm gonna
ask you one more time...

126
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:27,315
Are you honestly
fifteen years old?

127
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:28,582
I sure am.

128
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:29,782
I don't buy it.

129
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:32,415
It's the truth, I swear!

130
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,415
What's that?

131
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,415
What's happening?

132
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:39,648
We've got an intruder!
Come on! Give us a hand!

133
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:40,915
What?!

134
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:42,482
Behave yourself, got it?!

135
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:44,382
I will!

136
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:50,082
Lame! Lame! Lame!
Are you guys even trying?

137
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,882
You can do better than that!

138
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:53,315
He's still coming at us!

139
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:55,548
The guns don't even dent him!

140
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,382
Hold it! Stay back!

141
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,448
Got it!

142
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:14,448
This would be a lot more fun
if I was allowed to cut 'em up.

143
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:16,982
[Ling] Hello! Strange
armor-ghost-man?!

144
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:19,348
Do you think you could
let me out of here?

145
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:20,582
Who are you?

146
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:22,948
Just an illegal
immigrant from Xing.

147
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:25,315
Oh yeah? A foreigner?

148
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,582
Well, have a nice trip home.

149
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:28,782
If you let me out of here,
I could help you.

150
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:31,415
I don't have time
to deal with you.

151
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:34,748
Where did you say you were from?

152
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:36,915
Xing, east of the desert.

153
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:39,515
Come with me.

154
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:41,415
I'd be happy to.

155
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:49,348
[fighting sounds]

156
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:50,715
What?

157
00:09:57,715 --> 00:10:02,482
Well, hello there, sweetheart!
I've been lookin' for you!

158
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:05,082
You're from the
Fifth Laboratory!

159
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:08,748
You haven't forgotten
me! How sweet!

160
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:10,648
I remember you, too...

161
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:12,782
I think of you every
time I look at the hole

162
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:14,848
you put in my right hand...

163
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,515
Just like the hole you
put in that guy Hughes.

164
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:18,982
No! It wasn't me!

165
00:10:18,982 --> 00:10:20,215
Oh yeah?

166
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:23,915
According to the newspapers,
you're one guilty soldier-girl.

167
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,515
It can't be...

168
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:26,782
Oh, but it is...

169
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:28,682
Right now it's lookin'
like you'll be facing

170
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:30,582
the firing squad for sure.

171
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:31,815
It's not true!

172
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:34,382
They're wrong! If they would
just do a proper investigat--

173
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:37,015
Here are your choices...

174
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:38,915
Stay here and be
killed for murder...

175
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:42,815
or bust outta this joint
with me. Which will it be?

176
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:46,915
How is this happening?

177
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:49,548
Isn't there anything
else I can do?!

178
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,815
It sure doesn't look like it.

179
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:59,615
I have no choice! Mom! Dad!
Please forgive me!

180
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:03,548
Fine, let's go...

181
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:05,648
If this is how it has to be,
I'll escape with you.

182
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:07,948
But you better know a way
out of here, metal boy.

183
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:11,582
Oooh! You've got spunk!

184
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:13,815
I'll do what I have to do!

185
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,748
Yes... yes... right away.

186
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:25,382
Notify every zone in the city...
Maria Ross has broken out.

187
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:27,982
It appears she's with
a violent accomplice...

188
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:29,582
They must be caught.

189
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:32,382
If she resists...

190
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:34,948
...the order is "shoot to kill."

191
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:42,315
[Lt. Ross] How much further?

192
00:11:42,315 --> 00:11:44,348
[66] Just keep moving!

193
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:47,515
Lieutenant Ross?!

194
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:50,782
Edward! Alphonse!
What are you two doing here?!

195
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:54,415
[Both] Ah!! You're that guy!

196
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:55,715
[Al] And Ling, too?!

197
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,848
Uh, hey, guys.
What're you up to?

198
00:11:57,848 --> 00:11:59,648
[Ed] I could ask
the same of you!

199
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:03,015
[66] Quit chattering...
We don't have time for this!

200
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:05,015
[Ed] Why, you--!

201
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,315
All right, sweetheart,
take that back alley

202
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:09,382
and run straight to
the warehouse district.

203
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:10,948
The darkness oughta hide you.

204
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:13,648
Wait, hold on!
Tell us about Hughes!

205
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:17,615
[66] Get going! If the MPs
show up, they'll shoot you!

206
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:18,615
[Ed] Lieutenant Ross!

207
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:19,748
[66] Stay back!

208
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:23,648
[Al] No, wait! Lieutenant Ross!

209
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:41,415
You're Maria Ross... right?

210
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:48,582
What was that?!

211
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:50,415
Looks like they got her.

212
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:52,415
Hold it! Get back here!

213
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,515
Whoops! Missed me!

214
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:56,815
Let's go, foreigner!

215
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:57,882
Okie-dokie.

216
00:12:57,882 --> 00:13:01,615
Wait! Ling! What are you
doing with a guy like him?

217
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:05,382
I'll have to fill you in later!

218
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:06,848
What now?!

219
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:15,715
Hey there... Fullmetal.

220
00:13:20,682 --> 00:13:23,448
What happened here?

221
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:26,748
What happened here,
Colonel? Tell me!

222
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:28,782
<i>[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

223
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:34,476
<i>[Narrator]
Fullmetal Alchemist.</i>

224
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:48,144
Why, Colonel?

225
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,461
Why was Hughes murdered?

226
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,761
Why would Second
Lieutenant Ross...?

227
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:56,094
Why didn't you say anything?!

228
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:03,961
You threaten
a superior officer?

229
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:06,628
You forget yourself, Elric!

230
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:16,761
Brother, don't!

231
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:18,061
I'm gonna tear you apart!

232
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:19,528
No! I won't let you!

233
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:21,228
This bastard just killed Ross!

234
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,828
What? He did?

235
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:29,928
[Al] How could you
do that, Colonel?!

236
00:14:29,928 --> 00:14:32,128
Maria Ross was a fugitive.

237
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:36,461
Our orders were "shoot
to kill." So I did.

238
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:37,961
That's all you have to say?!

239
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:42,661
About Hughes' death...
I apologize for hiding it.

240
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:45,228
But you do not argue
against orders...

241
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:47,561
or ask for explanations.

242
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,528
Just follow them.

243
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:52,428
That's what it means
to be a soldier!

244
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:04,981
[Douglas] Colonel Mustang...

245
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:09,281
You will explain to me
what happened here at once.

246
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,414
The message went out
that if she resisted,

247
00:15:11,414 --> 00:15:13,681
we were permitted
to shoot to kill.

248
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:17,947
She resisted...
so I killed her.

249
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:20,947
I understand the brigadier
general was a friend.

250
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:23,447
Yeah.

251
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:25,947
He was a good man.

252
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:28,314
Perhaps, then, it
was one of your men

253
00:15:28,314 --> 00:15:30,381
who aided Lieutenant
Ross's escape.

254
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:32,714
One of my men? But why?

255
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,747
Why, Colonel?

256
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,281
I'll tell you why...

257
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:39,347
So you could burn her
to death with your own hand!

258
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:45,381
I think such speculation
is best avoided.

259
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:56,681
I'm truly sorry for
not telling you about

260
00:15:56,681 --> 00:15:59,314
Brigadier General
Hughes' death sooner.

261
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:03,581
It's my fault.

262
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:08,381
Don't be so hard on yourself...

263
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:11,381
His murder wasn't
your doing, Edward.

264
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,947
Is everyone here, then?

265
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:17,581
[Armstrong] Dr. Knox...

266
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:20,581
Her body was almost
completely destroyed.

267
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,947
But judging from what
little dental work remained,

268
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:26,681
I was able to conclude that
this is indeed Maria Ross.

269
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:28,881
It's an awful thing you did.

270
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:33,814
Turning a beauty like her
into a pile of charcoal.

271
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:36,814
You must have held quite
a grudge against her...

272
00:16:36,814 --> 00:16:38,747
Didn't you, Colonel?

273
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:44,781
Is the vengeance as sweet
as you imagined it?

274
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:50,781
The famous hero
of the Ishvalan War,

275
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:53,514
going this far against
a little girl.

276
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,847
It makes me sick.

277
00:16:59,447 --> 00:17:02,347
[Armstrong] Colonel...
Please allow me to apologize

278
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:05,414
for one of my own
officer's actions.

279
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:07,781
I could never have imagined
that Second Lieutenant Ross

280
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:10,481
would commit such
a heinous murder.

281
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:15,814
She was so straightforward and
earnest... compassionate...

282
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:18,314
A truly fine officer.

283
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:33,281
Fatigue seems to be getting
the best of you, Major.

284
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:36,414
Perhaps you should
take some leave.

285
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:40,814
Back east, where I was...
It's a nice place.

286
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:45,514
None of the big city noise...
and lots of beautiful women.

287
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:54,681
[Envy] After a daring escape,

288
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:56,814
the fugitive is killed
by Colonel Mustang,

289
00:17:56,814 --> 00:18:01,281
eager to avenge his best friend.
And all's well that ends well.

290
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,447
Are you so sure about that?

291
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:04,914
The plan was supposed
to be designed

292
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:08,381
to get Mustang
to behave himself.

293
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:09,481
He took the bait...

294
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:12,847
Now he doesn't have a reason
to snoop around anymore.

295
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:16,781
Besides... we did manage
to sow some animosity...

296
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:19,847
His subordinates won't
trust him much after this.

297
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:22,781
[Mustang] What's this?

298
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:24,681
It's a request for leave.

299
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:26,414
At a time like this?

300
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:28,247
Is that a 'no'?

301
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:30,981
No... It's fine.
Request approved.

302
00:18:30,981 --> 00:18:33,581
Thank you very much, sir.

303
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:49,947
What were you thinking, going
out on your own like that?!

304
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:52,747
Do you know what the Colonel
would do to me if he found out?

305
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:56,481
Oh, pipe down, will ya?
Nobody saw me.

306
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:59,281
Don't you get it?!
That isn't the point!

307
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:01,547
You're just a helpless
soldier held captive

308
00:19:01,547 --> 00:19:05,347
by a big, bad criminal...
What were you supposed to do?

309
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:06,781
Huh?

310
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,247
Hey! What're you
up to out there?

311
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:12,814
Building a signal fire.

312
00:19:12,814 --> 00:19:13,881
Signal fire?

313
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:16,314
Bringing someone back here
you know nothing about!

314
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:18,247
How could you be so stupid?

315
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:20,581
Young Lord! We've
been looking for you.

316
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:23,314
Wow... Impressive
response time.

317
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:25,314
Looks like a party.

318
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:31,947
Hello, Elizabeth...
how are you?

319
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:34,247
It's great to hear
from you, as usual...

320
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:35,981
Are you sure your assistant
won't give you grief

321
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:38,314
for blowing off work
to talk on the phone?

322
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:41,847
No, the coast is clear... she's
out of the office at the moment.

323
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:46,581
And a good thing, too, or else I
wouldn't be able to talk to you!

324
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:48,681
So how do you like
that? He's whipped.

325
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:52,447
The second the lieutenant goes
on leave, he gets like this.

326
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,447
You'd think Lieutenant
Hawkeye was...

327
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,647
...Colonel Mustang's
nanny or something.

328
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,247
Uh-huh, that's right...

329
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:00,547
You know I haven't had
a day off since I got here,

330
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,714
so I'm seriously considering
taking some leave time soon.

331
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:06,547
Oh? Where are you going to go?

332
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:10,481
I could use a nice,
relaxing fishing trip.

333
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:12,614
Care to come along?

334
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:24,447
Yeah? Who is it? What do you--

335
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,947
Major!? What the hell
did you do that for?

336
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:35,914
You listen to me,
Edward Elric...

337
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:40,447
Hmm, this no good.
No good at all.

338
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,214
Your automail seems
to be broken.

339
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:43,514
Um, okay...

340
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:46,281
Yes, this is a serious
situation indeed...

341
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:48,614
We'll have to
repair it at once.

342
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,947
There's no time to waste.

343
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:52,414
Allow me to escort you
to Resembool for repairs.

344
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:53,981
Um, Major... what's up?

345
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:55,414
What was that?

346
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:57,414
You're going back
home to Resembool?

347
00:20:57,414 --> 00:20:59,814
I have no idea what
he's talking about, Al!

348
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:01,847
And you, Alphonse Elric...

349
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:04,914
You would stand out too much,
so you remain here in Central.

350
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:05,781
Okay...

351
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:07,014
[Armstrong] Right!

352
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:09,614
We need to make arrangements for
transportation right away...

353
00:21:09,614 --> 00:21:11,547
Come along, Edward.

354
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:18,414
Cut it out, Major!
Put me down.

355
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:22,447
I'm afraid I can't do that...
These are my orders.

356
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,914
<i>From him...</i>

357
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:30,447
Okay, I got it... Roger that.

358
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:31,914
Major Armstrong
and Edward Elric

359
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:34,481
have gotten aboard
the train, sir.

360
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:35,914
Okay.

361
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:42,414
<i>Finally... everyone's
out of the way.</i>

362
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:49,914
I was able to locate a
witness that saw the man

363
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:52,214
who orchestrated
the break-out...

364
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:55,347
Here... This is a rough
sketch of the guy.

365
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,614
Oh, he's still alive, then?

366
00:21:57,614 --> 00:22:00,314
Is there any direct
connection to the colonel?

367
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:03,714
Who knows... My money says he's
the one behind it, though.

368
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:06,414
Where did he run off to?

369
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:08,714
Well, he did leave
pretty suddenly...

370
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:10,447
and he's good at hiding.

371
00:22:10,447 --> 00:22:13,447
In other words, you have
no idea... You're useless.

372
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:17,581
Don't blame this on me, you ugly
hag... I'm short on manpower.

373
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:18,781
Manpower?

374
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:20,314
[growls]

375
00:22:20,314 --> 00:22:22,981
But you've got plenty
of manpower right here.

376
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:24,881
[growls]

377
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:29,547
It looks like you're finally
on... Barry the Chopper.

378
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:31,947
[growls]

379
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:08,981
<i>[Narrator] The truth lies
in the ruins of Xerxes...</i>

380
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,914
<i>The survivors who remain
in the decayed, desolate city</i>

381
00:24:11,914 --> 00:24:14,647
<i>may hold the key to
wiping away the darkness</i>

382
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:17,914
<i>carried by one young man.</i>

383
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,614
<i>Next time on Fullmetal
Alchemist: Brotherhood...</i>

384
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:26,481
<i>Episode 18: "The Arrogant
Palm of a Small Human."</i>

385
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:31,914
<i>At long last... the
counterattack will begin.</i>
