00:00:01,123 --> 00:00:03,356
[gunshots]

2
00:00:03,356 --> 00:00:04,797
[Mustang] Elizabeth! Hey!

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,463
What's going on?!

4
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:47,491
[Ling] So this piece of info is
supposed to be confidential...

5
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:50,524
But whatever.. Barry told me
the Colonel's got a plan

6
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:52,824
to smoke out some military
guys he's been after...

7
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:55,924
the ones from the fifth
something or other.

8
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:57,924
The Fifth Laboratory.

9
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,191
Al?

10
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:03,024
I've gotta find them...
this could lead us

11
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:05,891
straight to the person who
killed Lieutenant Hughes.

12
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:10,424
Huh? Hey, not so fast!
Tell me your secret, first!

13
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:12,157
I'll tell you when
I get back, okay?

14
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:15,024
Oh, c'mon,
that's so unfair!

15
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:17,857
I'll be back soon.

16
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:23,191
Okay.. Just be careful.

17
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:26,157
I will.. I promise.

18
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,157
Are you all done now?

19
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:41,857
Then it's time to eat you.

20
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:46,657
[dog barks]

21
00:02:52,657 --> 00:02:55,157
Stop it! That tickles!

22
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:56,791
Catch!

23
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,824
Bullets gone? Goodie, goodie!

24
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:16,757
I get to have
dinner and desert!

25
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:22,057
[Gluttony screams]

26
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,691
I barely made it.

27
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:30,824
Colonel...

28
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:33,824
Why the hell did you
leave your post?!

29
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:34,957
No matter what
happened to us,

30
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:37,057
you could still have kept
your involvement a secret!

31
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:38,891
That was the whole
idea, right?!

32
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:41,524
But you just come waltzing
in here, plain as day!

33
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:43,157
Are you a complete idiot?!

34
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:47,557
Yeah, fine, fine, that's
it... I'm an idiot. Happy?

35
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:52,757
Who the heck
was that fat guy?

36
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:55,591
[Fuery] Colonel! The
target's on the move, sir!

37
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,791
Strike the camp, Sergeant!
Don't leave a single trace!

38
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,857
And you stay right by the
Sergeant's side, Hayate!

39
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:03,657
Sir! [ruff!]

40
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:06,524
[Hawkeye] Colonel?

41
00:04:06,524 --> 00:04:07,757
What is it?

42
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:09,757
Thanks for saving
us back there.

43
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:10,757
Tell me later...

44
00:04:10,757 --> 00:04:13,491
Let's just stay focused
on the mission for now.

45
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,891
Sir.

46
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,891
Quick, get in!

47
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:21,991
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,057
Are you trying to go after
Mr. Hughes' murderer?

49
00:04:32,224 --> 00:04:33,724
You in?

50
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:35,124
Yeah.

51
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:41,591
Don't let him get away.

52
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,557
He ain't goin' nowhere.

53
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:46,424
[66 laughs] My soul
won't be able to rest...

54
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:49,691
Not until I eviscerate
that meat bag!

55
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:51,924
So do you think we can
expect another appearance

56
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,691
from that blubber
beast back there?

57
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:56,891
I doubt it.. I scorched
him off the ledge.

58
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:58,757
Yeah, and I shot
him in the head.

59
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,591
But he didn't really
seem to mind.

60
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,491
[Al gasps] He didn't have
an Uroboros tattoo, did he?

61
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:06,757
A tattoo? Well...

62
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:09,991
Actually, yeah...
on his tongue.

63
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:14,791
In that case.. you were probably
dealing with a Homunculus.

64
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:18,157
[66 screams]

65
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:19,257
Watch it, Mustang!

66
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:22,757
Hold on a damn second!
What are you saying, Al...?

67
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,524
That's just not possible.

68
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,891
Yeah, that's what I thought,

69
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:28,491
until I got kidnapped
by a Homunculus...

70
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:30,091
He called himself Greed...

71
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:34,424
One thing he told me is
that nothing is impossible.

72
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:37,624
I know for a fact that they
have amazing healing powers.

73
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:41,057
I watched Greed get the top
half of his head knocked off...

74
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:43,624
but he was perfectly
fine a minute later.

75
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:45,491
They're real alright...

76
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:47,591
but I understand if
you don't believe me.

77
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:50,991
After what I just saw...
I have to believe you.

78
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:53,024
Hold on.. I
rendered fat boy

79
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:54,957
down to a bubbling
puddle back there...

80
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:57,591
Are you telling me
he's still alive?

81
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,024
[Al] Probably.

82
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,157
[Mustang] Wonderful...

83
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:03,957
It's just a never ending
parade of freaks lately, huh?

84
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,657
[tires screech]

85
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:19,891
[66] My body ran in there. Seems
to think it can hide from me.

86
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,624
[Mustang] The Third
Laboratory, huh?

87
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:25,891
So this ties them
directly to the military.

88
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:28,991
That's all we need for now...
We're pulling back.

89
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:30,624
Well, you have
fun with that!

90
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,057
Get back here!

91
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,491
That psycho stormed
the building.

92
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:36,991
Yep.. It's our lucky day.

93
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:38,957
Huh?

94
00:06:38,957 --> 00:06:39,924
[66 laughs]

95
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:42,691
[screams]

96
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,024
Outta my way!

97
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:47,124
I don't want any of your
boring old skin and bones!

98
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:50,057
I got me a special
reunion to get to!

99
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:55,824
All personnel must
evacuate immediately!

100
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:57,024
Um, Colonel?

101
00:06:57,024 --> 00:07:00,724
Stay back.. The man who broke
in is a deranged murderer.

102
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:02,657
My men will handle
his capture.

103
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:04,891
Order your guards
to seal off the exits!

104
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,557
Yes, sir!

105
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:19,057
[Havoc] How the hell are
we supposed to find him?

106
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:21,957
We're gonna
have to split up.

107
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:23,757
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:35,591
It doesn't look like anybody's
used this lab in a while.

109
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:38,857
I guess not...
What is this stuff?

110
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:41,857
I have no idea.. But
whatever they did here,

111
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:43,624
it was painful for someone.

112
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:46,391
Well now.. I am just shocked.

113
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,491
It's bad enough that you
stood me up on our date.

114
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:56,791
And now you
point a gun at me?

115
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,657
You've got some
nerve.. Don't you?

116
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:03,524
Solaris...? What's going on?

117
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,191
Hey, Havoc.

118
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:06,891
Your girl's got
the tattoo.

119
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:11,091
Yeah. First
I've seen it, sir.

120
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,491
Quit staring...
It's not very polite.

121
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:17,757
Well, I can see how she
tricked you so easily...

122
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:20,391
You've always been
a sucker for big boobs.

123
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:25,791
I can't help it!
I love 'em!

124
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:29,457
Did you tell this
woman anything?

125
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:33,457
No, I never said a single
thing about work, sir!

126
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:40,624
Tell me.. Do you know
who Maes Hughes is?

127
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:43,124
Oh.. yes, he was quite
the intelligent man,

128
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:44,257
wouldn't you agree?

129
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,491
I only wish I'd had the
opportunity to pick his brain.

130
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:48,991
[gunshot]

131
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:54,024
On your knees.. I
wanna know everything.

132
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:56,957
Sorry to say...

133
00:08:56,957 --> 00:08:58,957
But it's gonna take more
than you're capable of

134
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:00,791
to make me get on my kn--

135
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:07,691
[Lust laughs]
How merciless...

136
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:10,991
Did you pick that up
in Ishval? Huh?

137
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:15,024
You're a Homunculus!

138
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:18,491
Indeed.. How very
astute of you, Jean...

139
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,024
But I doubt you've
seen this one.

140
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:29,557
Take a good look, boys.
It's a Philosopher's Stone.

141
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:34,057
I was created with this
stone at my core...

142
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:37,791
It's not just a legend...
It's my heart.

143
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,491
You're a monster.

144
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:43,091
That was uncalled for...
I do have feelings...

145
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:47,024
Apart from a few things, I was
made nearly identical to you.

146
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:49,524
I am human.

147
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,991
I've got a funny feeling
the only reason you're

148
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:56,557
telling us this.. is 'cuz you
don't plan on letting us live.

149
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:58,924
Yep.. it's such a shame.

150
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:04,024
Too slow!

151
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:12,091
Oh, no, did I get your ignition
glove all wet? Silly me.

152
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,591
[both yell]

153
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:19,891
What are we gonna do?!

154
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:21,924
She'll shred us with
her freaky fingers!

155
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:25,424
No, she made
a big mistake...

156
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,957
She flooded the
room with water.

157
00:10:27,957 --> 00:10:31,624
A simple transmutation,
and we've got hydrogen gas.

158

<i>[Narrator]

160
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:58,640
Aw, crap...

161
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,740
This was a gift from one
of my ex-girlfriends...

162
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,640
Man.. Hey, Colonel? Ya mind
giving me a light, here?

163
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,573
Oh, right,
you're all wet.

164
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:13,906
Yeah?! Well, those things'll
kill you, you know that?!

165
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,873
She's dust.. I
definitely cremated her.

166
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:18,740
How do you know
for sure, sir?

167
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,373
The stench.

168
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:22,773
I'm pretty familiar
with that stink by now.

169
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:24,940
Ya mean from that time
you spent in Ishval?

170
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,706
For all we know, she
could still regenerate...

171
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:29,006
So stay alert.

172
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:30,473
Yes, sir.

173
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,606
Havoc!

174
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,973
Havoc! Hang in there!

175
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:50,373
Don't kid yourself.
He's a dead man.

176
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:52,840
No, he's not!

177
00:11:55,106 --> 00:11:58,973
Give up! There's nothing
you can do that'll kill me!

178
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:02,473
Then you won't mind...
If I borrow this!

179
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:16,473
I need it to save Havoc.

180
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,706
I don't know that much
about medicinal alchemy...

181
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:25,640
But this should
amplify my abilities.

182
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,673
It seems like you should
buy a girl dinner first...

183
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:33,106
before you stick your
hand in her chest.

184
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:48,640
Uh-- Uh... Your Excellency!

185
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,506
What's the current status?

186
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:52,906
[Guard] The criminal responsible

187
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,006
for the prison break
has stormed the premises,

188
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:58,640
but Colonel Mustang and
his men are in pursuit.

189
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,840
Well then.. I'll give
him some backup.

190
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,040
Very good! We're right
behind you, sir!

191
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,573
No.

192
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:08,440
I'd prefer to
handle it on my own.

193
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:13,673
I told you...

194
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:16,506
The Philosopher's
Stone is my core.

195
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:24,506
I really hate to do this...
you were a prime candidate

196
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:28,873
for sacrifice and all. But
you've forced me to kill you.

197
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:30,873
Damn you.

198
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:34,506
Save your breath...
I want you to watch

199
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:38,440
poor Jean bleed to death...
then you can die.

200
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,973
Jean.. hey. Answer me!
Havoc! You can't die...

201
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:49,906
Not yet. Not before I do.

202
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:53,673
Havoc...

203
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:04,506
Sorry. But ya
got here too late.

204
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:08,906
Look at this mess.. My body
is damn near entirely decayed.

205
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:10,940
[66] I guess a body
just can't hold up

206
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,073
with someone else's soul
being shoved inside of it.

207
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:16,906
[Al gasps]

208
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:20,973
If a soul is incompatible
with another person's body...

209
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:25,440
wouldn't it be the same for a
soul bonded to a suit of armor?

210
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,806
If that's right...
there's no guarantee

211
00:14:27,806 --> 00:14:29,906
I'll be able to stay in
this form long enough

212
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:32,073
to get our old bodies back...

213
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,973
Brother...

214
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:37,506
[66 chuckles]

215
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:40,706
I was wondering when you
were gonna show up, Lusty.

216
00:14:40,706 --> 00:14:42,406
Number Sixty Six...

217
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:45,140
Care to explain why you're
helping the Colonel?

218
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,506
I thought it'd be fun to
switch things up.. Besides...

219
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:53,406
I've wanted to chop
you up since I met you.

220
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:55,706
You're such a
handful, Sixty Six...

221
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:58,073
And I'm sad to see
you here, armor boy...

222
00:14:58,073 --> 00:15:00,440
You just had
to tag along.

223
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,106
Talk about a setback...
It's bad enough to lose one...

224
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:08,840
But now you're forcing me
to kill a second candidate.

225
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,706
Candidate?
A second one?

226
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:14,406
Yeah.. You and Mr. Gallantry.

227
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:16,806
That's enough of the
casual chit chat, Lust!

228
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:19,673
All I wanna hear
from you is screaming!

229
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:34,596
I do hate over-confident men.

230
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:37,663
Now then.. Where were we?
I think I was about

231
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:40,729
to send the Lieutenant
to join her superior.

232
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:49,829
Wait a minute...

233
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:53,796
So when you said you'd
already had to kill someone...

234
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:56,663
It can't be...
You didn't!

235
00:15:59,863 --> 00:16:01,796
You biiittch!!

236
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,863
[Hawkeye screams]

237
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:28,463
Are you done?

238
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:47,529
[Hawkeye sobs]

239
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,929
Such a sad and weak creature...
Another typical human.

240
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,863
Stand up, Lieutenant...
You need to get out of here.

241
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:01,263
Do you want me
to kill you first?

242
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:09,496
Oh, my.. It appears
you've opened the portal.

243
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:17,496
Such a shame.. You are
a perfect candidate.

244
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:24,763
Listen, Alphonse...
Leave me and save yourself.

245
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:25,696
No!

246
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:26,829
Run!

247
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,963
I won't!

248
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:28,996
Go!

249
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:32,029
I won't leave you!

250
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:34,396
I'm sick of
watching people die!

251
00:17:34,396 --> 00:17:36,996
And I can't just sit back
and take it anymore!

252
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:39,429
I won't let anyone
else get killed!

253
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,663
Not when I can protect them!

254
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:50,863
Well spoken...
I couldn't agree more.

255
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:06,296
Looks like I can get you
on your knees after all.

256
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:12,629
<i>[Lust] He's using the
flint for ignition..</i>

257
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:16,263
<i>and he carved a transmutation
circle into his hand!</i>

258
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,463
You should have
bled to death by now!

259
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:22,763
I seared the wound closed...

260
00:18:22,763 --> 00:18:25,796
I came close to passing
out from the pain.

261
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:29,896
[Lust screams]

262
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:31,963
You told me I
couldn't kill you...

263
00:18:31,963 --> 00:18:34,429
but I'd like to try
and prove you wrong.

264
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:38,763
So let's see.. How many
times is it gonna take?!

265
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:42,029
[Lust screams]

266
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,729
Colonel!

267
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:46,329
[Lust screams]

268
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:57,829
[Lust screams]

269
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:19,629
[Lust] You killed me.

270
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:23,296
I hate losing.. but there
are worse ways to die

271
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,629
than at the hands
of a man like you.

272
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:28,996
I love how cold and
focused your eyes are.

273
00:19:28,996 --> 00:19:31,063
I look forward...

274
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:35,396
to the day when those eyes
will be wide with agony...

275
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:39,029
It's coming...
It's coming...

276
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:48,563
Colonel!

277
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:51,563
Are you alright?

278
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:54,896
Forget about me, we need
to get you some help!

279
00:19:54,896 --> 00:19:56,596
Thanks, Alphonse...

280
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,896
Thank you for looking
after my subordinate.

281
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:01,663
Yeah, sure, we need
to call you a doctor.

282
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,296
[Mustang] Oh,
yeah.. hurry...

283
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:08,696
Call a doctor for
Havoc... Please.

284
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:24,398
He's alright.. He's alright.

285
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:37,698
Uh, hey.. I'm home now.

286
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:43,598
Moron! Welcome back!

287
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:47,265
Uh, okay.. Thanks?

288
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:51,298
I- I... W-Well...

289
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:59,332
[both laughing]

290
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:00,665
[clank, thud]

291
00:21:00,665 --> 00:21:02,632
[Winry screams]
That shouldn't happen!

292
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:06,665
[Al] It won't stay!
I- I can't put it back on!

293
00:21:09,865 --> 00:21:14,132
Holey moley.. That was
way too damn close.

294
00:21:14,132 --> 00:21:16,298
I hope someone can fix me...

295
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:21,065
I'd rather not live
my life as sheet metal.

296
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:24,265
Ah! What the...?! How the
hell are you still alive?!

297
00:21:25,665 --> 00:21:29,198
Hey... Oh, no! Put
me down right now!

298
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:32,065
I- I've got a second chance
to terrorize the city!

299
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:33,598
You're gonna ruin everything!

300
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:37,598
No... Don't do it, wait!
No, stop! Please!

301
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:53,632
