1
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,400
[KNOCS] Can you
tell me which room

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,633
Colonel Roy Mustang is in?

3
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:21,100
[RECPTIONIST]
Well...

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,533
Can I ask what your
relation to the patient is?

5
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:26,133
I'm his private practice doctor.

6
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:28,366
Just tell him Knocs
is here to see him.

7
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,600
[KNOCS] Ah, hey
there, young lady.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,533
[ROSS] Well, this
is a nice surprise.

9
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,033
And who is this
you've brought with you?

10
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,266
[KNOCS] That's a
bit of a long story...

11
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:46,766
But if you need to know...

12
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:49,200
He's kind of
my secret weapon.

13
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,766
[KNOCS]
So how's he doin'...?

14
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,400
Has this whole
thing got him down?

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,100
[ROY] The farming
method that's used

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,333
in the Ishvalan region...

17
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,700
They mainly double crop.

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,633
[BREDA]
Nope... that's close...

19
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:04,233
But it's called
dual-cropping...

20
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,166
Now think...

21
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,766
You've gotta know
this stuff inside out.

22
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,633
[ROY] Yeah...
And I do know it.

23
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:09,766
[BREDA]
Is that so...?

24
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:10,700
Which two crops

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,133
are the Ishvalans
known for cultivating?

26
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,500
[ROY]
Wheat and cotton.

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,133
[BREDA] That's correct...
Not a bad guess.

28
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,566
[ROY] C'mon, give
me some credit...

29
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:21,200
I've been researching
this stuff long before now.

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,266
[ROSS] He's hoping to
make amends with Ishval...

31
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,400
He wants to
make things right

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,333
before becoming
the Fuhrer.

33
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,500
[KNOCS]
Well... ambitious.

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,800
And what makes him so sure

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,266
he'll become the Fuhrer?

36
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:32,466
[ROY] That voice...

37
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,233
How long have you
been in here, Dr. Knocs?

38
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:37,033
[KNOCS] Not long...

39
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:38,700
So you don't
look so bad...

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,400
How're you adjusting?

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,500
[ROY] Well...
I can't get any rest...

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,766
Thanks to these pests.

43
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:46,766
[KNOCS] No, I meant
those eyes of yours, Roy.

44
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:49,066
How are they?

45
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,333
[ROY]
Right.

46
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,766
I envisioned a better future...

47
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:55,533
and this is the price
I had to pay for it.

48
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,400
[KNOCS] And are
you okay with that?

49
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,666
[ROY] Well,
I wouldn't say okay...

50
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:01,766
but still...

51
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:04,466
I won't let it stop me
from moving forward, either.

52
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,300
[KNOCS]
So tell me something...

53
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,066
You're gonna aid in
the restructure of Ishval?

54
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:13,233
[ROY] The Ishvalan War
of Extermination...

55
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,633
That's where
everything went wrong.

56
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:17,500
[KNOCS]
You're right, there...

57
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,233
Both for our country...

58
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:21,166
And for you and me.

59
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,666
[ROY]
It's time to correct it.

60
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:23,733
[KNOCS]
Correct it?

61
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:26,500
[ROY] I'm calling off
the military occupation...

62
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,100
And then I'll
return their holy land

63
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,233
to the Ishvalans left
living in the slums...

64
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,366
There's still a
lot to be done.

65
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,200
[FUERY]
We owe them plenty...

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,166
We'd all be dead now

67
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,700
if it weren't for Scar
and the Ishvalans...

68
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,433
It's the very least we
can do to repay them.

69
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,366
[FALMAN]
Colonel...

70
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:44,733
I brought all the
materials you asked for.

71
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,300
[HAWKEYE] We know that
this won't erase our sins...

72
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,433
but it's not too
late to fix things.

73
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,666
[KNOCS] This room just
reeks of optimism...

74
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,233
Hey, Dr. Marcoh,
listen to this...

75
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,566
They're already one
step ahead of you in here.

76
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,500
[ROY] Marcoh...?
Dr. Marcoh's here?

77
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:12,414
[MARCOH]
Colonel Mustang...

78
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:16,747
[MARCOH] I've brought a
Philosopher's Stone with me.

79
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,347
I believe that it might be able

80
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,514
to return your eyesight.

81
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:24,614
[ROY]
I suppose so.

82
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,347
[MARCOH]
This Stone here...

83
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:29,747
I created this Stone

84
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:34,081
by sacrificing the
lives of many Ishvalans.

85
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,181
[MARCOH]
It might be presumptuous

86
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,014
of me to ask this, but...

87
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:41,347
if your... intentions are
to help their relatives...

88
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:46,714
[MARCOH]
No.

89
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:50,747
I have no right to speak for
those whose lives I've taken...

90
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:54,414
So I'm asking this as
a personal request...

91
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:58,381
Let me heal you with this
stone so you can restore Ishval.

92
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:04,514
[ROY] I know some people
who might not like this...

93
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:06,381
Especially Fullmetal.

94
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:13,214
[ROY] But I will
accept your offer.

95
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:17,147
[ROY] And I'll devote my life
to seeing Ishval restored...

96
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:19,114
But first thing's first.

97
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:21,081
[ROY]
There's someone else

98
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:24,481
who needs that Stone
even more than I do.

99
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:27,281
[ROY] You can heal
me after you heal him.

100
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:35,447
[phone ringing]

101
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:36,581
[HAVOC] From our
hearts to your home,

102
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:38,981
you've reached the
Havoc General Store!

103
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,681
[HAVOC]
Hey, Breda... What's up?

104
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,147
[HAVOC] Do what...?
Come to Central...?

105
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:49,414
You'll explain
when I get there...?

106
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,147
This better be worth it.

107
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:57,347
[OLIVIER] How are
you healing, Scar?

108
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:58,747
[SCAR]
Why did you save me?

109
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:00,514
[OLIVIER] The only
interest I had in saving you

110
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:02,347
was for your alkahestry...

111
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:04,147
But plans do change...

112
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:06,281
Colonel Mustang's
requested Major Miles

113
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,214
to assist him in dealing
with Ishvalan affairs.

114
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:10,214
[MILES]
So...

115
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:12,214
I thought you might
be able to assist me...

116
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:14,747
Not as Scar...
the killer that is...

117
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:18,547
But as a true Ishvalan.

118
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:19,647
[MILES]
How 'bout it...?

119
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:23,014
Will you help me spread
the teachings of Ishvala?

120
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:28,281
[MILES] We can't allow our
religion and culture to die out.

121
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:31,314
That would be the
death of our race.

122
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:32,747
And this is our chance...

123
00:05:32,747 --> 00:05:35,081
We can rescue our people.

124
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:40,581
<i>[SCAR] Is this why
I was saved from death...?</i>

125
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:42,614
<i>Have you given me
this responsibility</i>

126
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:46,547
<i>as my reason to
continue living, brother?</i>

127
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,747
[SCAR]
I accept.

128
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:51,481
I'll join you...
From now on...

129
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:54,047
I'll follow you
wherever you see fit.

130
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:57,347
[OLIVIER] All right, Miles,
you can take it from here.

131
00:05:57,347 --> 00:05:59,581
Try not to disappoint me.

132
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:00,681
[MILES]
Sir!

133
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,347
<i>[OLIVIER]
Oh, Mustang...</i>

134
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:04,481
<i>I wish I could see
the look on your face...</i>

135
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:07,747
<i>when you find out
Scar's still alive.</i>

136
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:10,647
[OLIVIER]
Scar...

137
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:12,714
Why don't you tell
us your real name?

138
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:20,514
[SCAR]
I've died twice now...

139
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:24,714
I'm neither of the
people I once was...

140
00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:26,314
I don't need a name...

141
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:28,314
Call me anything.

142
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:30,747
[OLIVIER]
Fair enough.

143
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:33,247
You take care... Ishvalan.

144
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:50,214
[ED]
Are you okay?

145
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:52,081
[AL] I didn't realize
my muscles had atrophied

146
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:54,047
so much on the other side.

147
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,981
[ED] Do you want
me to carry you?

148
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:58,247
[AL]
No. Thanks...

149
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:00,114
I can walk around on my own.

150
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,647
[AL] I'll just move
at my own pace...

151
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:06,481
You can go ahead if you want.

152
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:08,781
[ED] Nope...
We left home together...

153
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:11,114
and that's how
we're gonna return.

154
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:19,581
[AL] Well...
we better get moving then.

155
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,114
[ED]
Yep.

156
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:28,347
[AL] So, brother...
How's the leg?

157
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,347
[ED]
Well... Ehh...

158
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:31,614
I haven't maintained it
in a while, so y'know...

159
00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:32,714
It's stiff.

160
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,081
[AL]
Thank you, brother.

161
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,714
[ED] Huh...?
Thanks for what?

162
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:41,481
[AL]
Oh, never mind.

163
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:44,214
[ED] Whatever...
Quit acting so weird.

164
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,247
[AL] I wonder
how Ling is doing...

165
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:49,247
Do you think they
made it back to Xing?

166
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:52,747
[ED] It's been two
months since they left...

167
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,647
I'm sure they're back by now.

168
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:58,647
[AL]
I... hope May's okay.

169
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,014
[ED] You've got
nothing to worry about...

170
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,047
She's in trustworthy hands.

171
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,281
[AL]
May.

172
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,247
[MAY CHANG]
Oh, Alphonse.

173

[AL]
No...

320
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,849
It's equivalent
if you take ten

321
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,182
and then give ten back.

322
00:16:58,182 --> 00:16:59,315
But if you take ten...

323
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:01,149
and then add
something of yourself...

324
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:02,849
you return eleven.

It's not much...

have to go out

it actually works.

[AL]
Yes.

346
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:49,382
[ZAMPANO]
Then the time is nigh.

347
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:50,482
[GERSO]
You ready?

348
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:53,282
[AL]
I'm off to Xing!

349
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,915
[AL] May's gonna
teach me everything

350
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:58,315
there is to know
about Alkhahestry.

351
00:17:58,315 --> 00:17:59,982
But I'm not
stopping there...

352
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:02,115
I'm gonna travel
all over the east...

353
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:05,315
and study everything
I can about their cultures.

354
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:07,882
[AL] I wanna
see all I can...

355
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:08,482
and learn all I can...

356
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:10,749
and meet new people.

357
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:13,982
[AL]
So you guys...

358
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:15,749
You're really coming along?

359
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:17,915
[ZAMPANO] Hell yes we're coming!
[GERSO] Hell yes we're coming!

360
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:19,249
[GERSO] Good things
are bound to happen

361
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:20,182
if we stick with you!

362
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,349
[ZAMPANO] And you
can't argue with us...

363
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:22,615
[ZAMPANO] That's based on...
[GERSO] That's based on...

364
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:25,149
[ZAMPANO] Our animal instincts!
[GERSO] Our animal instincts!

365
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:26,815
[PIG] Rhee-rhee!
[FROG] Ribbit-ribbit!

366
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,215
[ZAMPANO] The truth is...

367
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:32,049
[ZAMPANO]
We're gonna find a way

368
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,315
to get our original
bodies back...

369
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:35,249
You're the one who told us

370
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,115
that we should never give up.

371
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,482
[GERSO] You said
to act for ourselves

372
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:40,415
and not leave it to others.

373
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:42,749
[AL]
Mm-hmm.

374
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,315
[GERSO] So your brother
isn't going with you?

375
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:46,349
[AL]
Nope.

376
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:47,482
I'm gonna take the east...

377
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:51,515
and Brother's heading west
to learn from that region.

378
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:52,249
And if we then combine

379
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:54,349
the knowledge of
east and west...

380
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:56,115
We might be able to
prevent the tragedy

381
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:58,349
that befell Nina
from happening again.

382
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:01,515
[AL]
But that's not all.

383
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,915
We've got more in mind...

384
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:04,749
It's not just for research.

385
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,849
[AL]
It's an enormous world...

386
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,415
and we want to see it all.

387
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:15,990
[WINRY] Make sure
to oil it everyday.

388
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,990
[ED]
Right.

389
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,357
[WINRY] And please keep
the screws tightened.

390
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:20,323
[ED]
Yeah.

391
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:21,423
[WINRY]
Dry it off immediately

392
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:23,890
when you get
out of the tub.

393
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,690
[ED]
Fine.

394
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,990
[WINRY]
Are you even listening?

395
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,157
[ED]
Yeah.

396
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,390
[WINRY]
There's your train.

397
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:41,090
[WINRY]
Knowing you...

398
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,823
You're probably gonna
break it within a month

399
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:44,790
and have to come
home for maintenance.

400
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,223
[ED] Yeah, yeah...
You're probably right.

401
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:50,190
[WINRY] Well, whenever
that does happen...

402
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,390
Just call me to
make an appointment.

403
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,023
[ED]
Sure.

404
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:00,090
[ED]
An appointment?

405
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,757
[WINRY]
What's wrong?

406
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,790
Listen, Winry...

407
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,357
Well, what...?

408
00:20:14,357 --> 00:20:16,423
Just come
out and say it.

409
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:24,023
Equivalent exchange!

410
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:24,857
Huh?

411
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,523
[ED] I'll give half
of my life to you

412
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:29,257
if you give half
of yours to me!

413
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,090
[WINRY]
Awww... Come on...

414
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,523
Do you have to treat
everything like alchemy...?

415
00:20:43,523 --> 00:20:46,557
The whole equivalent
exchange thing is just nonsense.

416
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:48,390
[ED]
What'd you say?

417
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,957
[WINRY]
It's nonsense...!

418
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,290
How 'bout I just
give you my whole life?

419
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,223
[WINRY] Uh...
Maybe not all of it...!

420
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:05,923
Ninety, maybe
eighty percent?

421
00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:07,857
Seventy...?
That's not enough...

422
00:21:07,857 --> 00:21:09,457
But eighty-five... Yeah...!

423
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:11,790
Eighty-five is
a good number!

424
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,957
[WINRY]
What?!

425
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:16,390
[WINRY]
Shut up!

426
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,757
[ED]
I'm sorry, really!

427
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,357
[WINRY]
Edward!

428
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:25,257
[ED]
You are so incredible...

429
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:26,523
You knocked
equivalent exchange

430
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:29,390
flat on its butt
in just a few words.

431
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,157
[WINRY] Uh...
And what's that mean...?

432
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,423
Are you making fun of me?

433
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:33,823
[ED]
Not at all!

434
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,957
[ED] Thanks for
cheering me up...

435
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:43,290
I'll miss you...
Goodbye for now.

436
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,823
[WINRY]
Come home soon.

437
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:51,390
[train whistle]

438
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:04,390
[FEMALE STATION HAND]
Ohh...

439
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,523
So I see Edward's doing
some traveling as well...

440
00:22:07,523 --> 00:22:11,157
Why can't those boys just
settle down for a while?

441
00:22:11,157 --> 00:22:13,857
[WINRY] It's good for
them to keep moving.

442
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:17,990
[WINRY] Men who sit around
doing nothing are boring.

443
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:21,790
<i>[ED] There's no such thing
as a painless lesson...</i>

444
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,290
<i>They just don't exist.</i>

445
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,490
<i>Sacrifices are necessary...</i>

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,290

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,357

can endure that pain...</i>

448
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:35,123

00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:37,423

450

451
00:22:41,423 --> 00:22:44,790
<i>[ED] Yeah...
A heart made fullmetal.</i>
