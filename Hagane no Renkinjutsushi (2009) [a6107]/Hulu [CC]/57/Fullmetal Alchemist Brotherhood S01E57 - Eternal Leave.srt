00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:49,639
We can't turn our
backs on this fight now.

356
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,573
We're on a path leading directly
to the heart of the enemy.

357
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:54,506
We didn't come all
this way just to pass up

358
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:57,773
the chance to storm in there
and pop some ventricles.

359
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,873
Are you sure
about this?

360
00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:08,373
You saved our lives.

361
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:11,873
Thanks for your help...

362
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:14,839
Don't mention it...
Good luck, General Armstrong.

[NARRATOR]
Anger is born from the
extreme depths of human sorrow.

380
00:24:08,006 --> 00:24:09,173
And when two souls,

381
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:12,639
both shaken to their very
core with the rage of loss,

382
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:15,039
attempt to control
the same body,

383
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,406
they will only unleash
true annihilation.

was to continue protecting
him... even after his demise.
