1
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,000
Hello, Edward.. You appear
to have grown some.

2
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,300
I spoke with Pinako.

3
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,433
You tried human transmutation.

4
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:48,966
What makes you think
you can show up like this?

5
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:52,966
There's nothing left
for you here anymore!

6
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:56,366
I noticed.
Tell me, Edward.

7
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,166
What possessed you
to burn down my home?

8
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:03,533
After what happened,
we vowed to never turn back...

9
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,400
We did it as a symbol
of our resolve.

10
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,366
No you didn't. You were
hiding the memory.

11
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:13,833
You didn't want to be reminded
of what you've done...

12
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,433
And thought you could
erase the memory

13
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:17,533
by destroying the evidence.

14
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,566
You're wrong!

15
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,833
It's just like a child
who hides the sheets

16
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,200
after he wets the bed.

17
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,300
You ran away...
And you know it.

18
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,966
I.. You don't
know a damn thing!

19
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:37,200
You make me sick
to my stomach.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,333
He's exactly like I was
when I was his age.

21
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,966
[door opens]

22
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:00,400
[laughter]

23
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:26,600
[growls]

24
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,033
You haven't changed
in the slightest.

25
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:34,100
All these years.. and you
look exactly the same.

26
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,166
Where have you
been all this time?

27
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,133
Why didn't you
come back sooner?

28
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:42,333
Trisha was waiting for
you until the very end...

29
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,966
Pinako.

30
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,133
Hmm?

31
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,866
The life form my
sons transmuted...

32
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,266
Are you positive
that it was Trisha?

33
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:03,033
Huh? Well I wouldn't--

34
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:05,433
It didn't even
look human to me...

35
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:06,600
so I wouldn't
think of it as--

36
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,866
No.. that's not
what I'm asking.

37
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:13,833
Did you notice the eye color?
Or the hair color?

38
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,366
What are you
trying to get at?!

39
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:21,400
Are you telling me that
that wasn't even Trisha?!

40
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,333
For all that those
boys sacrificed...

41
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,133
You're saying that
thing they created

42
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,366
wasn't even their mother?!

43
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:33,033
[Ling] Whoa! You don't
sleep or eat...

44
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,600
You don't even run
out of breath?

45
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,566
Uh-huh.. I just have
to make sure the seal

46
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:38,266
doesn't get harmed.

47
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:42,433
That's so cool.. So you really
are immortal then, huh?

48
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:44,433
No, I'm not.

49
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:48,333
This body... It's
like a time bomb.

50
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,200
Barry mentioned something...
And it made me realize that

51
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,600
any type of body is incompatible
with a foreign soul...

52
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,466
Pairing them together.. the body
will eventually reject it.

53
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:03,200
It could happen tomorrow...
or ten years from now...

54
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,300
but it's inevitable
that it will.

55
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,233
Oh, no.. Al, we've gotta get you
back in your regular body.

56
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:13,200
Well.. Hold on.. If it's
about to give out on you...

57
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,100
Couldn't you just transfer your
soul into some other object?

58
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,333
'Cuz if that's the case...
then for the time being...

59
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,166
Well, you're impervious to pain
and you don't have to eat!

60
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,133
It sounds like
a great deal to me!

61
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:30,066
No, it isn't! You don't know
what you're talking about!

62
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,033
Sorry.

63
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,566
Winry!

64
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,133
[knock on door]

65
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,166
[Al] Winry? I'm coming in.

66
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:59,833
Y'know.. you and Brother always
gotta be the first to explode...

67
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,933
I never get the chance
to be the one to get mad.

68
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:07,200
It's just.. well...

69
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,866
I guess I can't fall asleep...

70
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:16,300
I don't think this
body will let me.

71
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,966
Oh.

72
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:29,933
Just tell me you're gonna
get your body back... Okay?

73
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,566
[running footsteps]

74
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:38,566
Give it back! You have to give
my brother his body back!

75
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:42,566
He's the only family I have!
I won't let you take it!

76
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:44,033
Take it?

77
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,100
Do you even know
what you're saying?

78
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
You're the one who
tossed his body aside

79
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,166
and put him in that armor...
Aren't you, alchemist?

80
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,066
[Tucker] It's true.

81
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:59,433
You and I are exactly the
same. Accept it, Edward.

82
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,900
We make monsters.

83
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,100
Edward.

84
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,133
Why did you leave
me here like this?

85
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:14,200
[Pinako] Ed? Get out
of bed already!

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,933
Your father's about
to head out.

87
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,166
This one.. Do you
mind if I keep it?

88
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:28,200
It's the only photo we had
taken with all four of us.

89
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,166
Of course, you're
welcome to it.

90
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,933
Thank you.

91
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:37,366
I need to tell you
something important, Pinako.

92
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:44,466
Something terrible is going
to happen in this country soon...

93
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,433
You should escape
while you can.

94
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:50,233
This country's lousy
with terrible things...

95
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:52,833
And I can't leave.
I've got other people

96
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,800
who need me here in case
they want to come home.

97
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,066
I've given you my warning.

98
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:04,166
Hey Hohenheim, wait!

99
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,266
Try not to be such
a stranger, alright?

100
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,200
I wish I could, Pinako...

101
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,800
It's too bad I won't get
to enjoy your cooking anymore.

102
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:28,712
[thunder]

103
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:45,247
You're not really gonna
dig it up.. Are you, Ed?

104
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:52,814
Why don't we go back.

105
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:56,254
No.. My stumps are
aching from the weather.

106
00:08:56,254 --> 00:09:00,254
It's about to rain...
Let's just hurry and do this.

107
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:20,421
Ed!

108
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:22,621
Don't push yourself!

109
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:32,021
Let's head on home.

110
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,721
No.

111
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:38,354
I'm not gonna be able to move
forward until I know for sure...

112
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:39,688
And besides...

113
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:41,754
You ran away.

114
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:44,388
I won't run
away from this.

115
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:47,121
Granny.. Mom's hair was
a light chestnut color.

116
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:49,388
This is black.

117
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:54,421
This femur...
It's much too long.

118
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:59,354
And this pelvis?
I'm pretty sure it's male.

119
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:02,054
It is?

120
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:06,188
I'm sorry... But I'm afraid
this isn't your mother, Ed.

121
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:22,554
[Ed laughs]

122
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:25,921
Then that's it...

123
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:29,621
It really is impossible to
bring the dead back to life...

124
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:32,388
The undeniable truth...

125
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:36,588
It was impossible
all along...

126
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:40,688
Edward.. Now Listen to me...

127
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:43,621
You've gotta get
a hold of yourself.

128
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:48,788
I'm okay, Granny...
It's okay.

129
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:50,488
From the moment
I made this thing,

130
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:53,254
it's been the symbol
of my despair...

131
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,221
But not anymore...

132
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:57,454
Now it's an emblem of hope.

133
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:00,488
Al can be returned to normal.

134

136
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:26,278
[phone ringing]

137
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,621
Curtis residence.. I didn't
expect this.. You never call.

138
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:37,587
Uh, yeah.. I need to ask
you something, Teacher.

139
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:40,454
But, well...

140
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:43,454
Well what? Spit it out.

141
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:49,487
It has to do with when you
tried to transmute your baby.

142
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:54,287
What about it, Ed?

143
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:58,121
The thing is.. What Al
and I transmuted...

144
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:01,621
It wasn't actually our mother.

145
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:05,421
What is this, Ed? What
are you trying to tell me?

146
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:09,521
I'm sorry to ask you this,
but the child you transmuted...

147
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:13,487
Are you sure that it was your
child that you brought back?

148
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:17,387
[phone is hung up]

149
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:28,054
Thank you, Ed.

150
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:32,954
It's good to know my son
and his wife helped people.

151
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:35,321
I'm proud of them.

152
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:44,587
So, Hohenheim...

153
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:47,254
Did he even bother to say
where he was going?

154
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:49,621
Of course he didn't...
And I didn't a-

155
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,221
Ahhh! What's wrong with me?

156
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:55,221
I can't believe I forgot
to give him the message!

157
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,921
A message?

158
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:02,321
Yes. A last request...
From your mother.

159
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:08,154
I'll be gone when he returns...
Can you tell him something?

160
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:11,621
I need him to know...
I couldn't keep my promise...

161
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:16,587
I died before he did...
and I'm so sorry.

162
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:18,621
A promise?
What promise?

163
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:21,321
You got me...
Sorry to ask,

164
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:23,921
but could you pass it on
if you bump into him?

165
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:25,354
Why should I have to?

166
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:27,521
I know it doesn't
seem like it...

167
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:29,921
but he does care about
you and your brother.

168
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:32,287
Teh! Yeah, I'll pass it on...

169
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,554
Right after I clock
him in the face.

170
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:39,854
[Pinako] Heading back to
Central already, are you?

171
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:42,487
[Ed] Yeah.. Al's
probably mad at me...

172
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:45,821
I'm gonna have plenty
of explaining to do.

173
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:52,254
What the helllll?!

174
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:53,187
I'm sorry, brother!

175
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:57,187
You..! What..! How are
you this beat up?!

176
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,587
Ahhh!

177
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:00,054
And you!

178
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:02,054
What the hell
are you doing here?!

179
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:04,221
Eating a delicious dinner.

180
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:09,121
Seriously.. How did
this happen to you?

181
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,187
[Ed] A Homunculus and
Barry the Chopper...

182
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:15,587
And just to throw
a cherry on top,

183
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:18,821
you find out your body
might reject your soul.

184
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,154
I'm gonna have to
extend what little

185
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,321
you have left of your armor.

186
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:39,587
Ed? He'll be able to get
his body back, right?

187
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:43,821
Yeah, of course he will! I
told you I'm gonna get it back.

188
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:53,441
Al.. I've gotta tell
you something...

189
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:56,607
I dug up the body that we
transmuted in Resembool.

190
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:59,329
What?! Why would
you do that?

191
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:02,529
Because, Al.. I found out
that the thing we buried

192
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,995
wasn't really our mother.

193
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:11,797
But.. Hold on a minute...
Then that means...

194
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:13,897
The thing we made...
I don't know what,

195
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:15,764
but it was something
completely different.

196
00:16:15,764 --> 00:16:18,764
But if it wasn't, then
what happened to me...?

197
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:19,997
That's just it...

198
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:23,331
This has actually convinced me
we can return you to normal.

199
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:24,764
Ed, Are you sure?

200
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:28,864
Yeah.. But, before I
start explaining how...

201
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:32,331
Well.. Uh, Winry...
Do, um.. Uh...

202
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,864
Do you remember when
Al and I got in a fight

203
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:37,731
when we were kids about...
who'd marry you?

204
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,831
Huh? The fight we were
talking about on the roof?

205
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:43,764
Yeah, that one. Al told
me you turned him down.

206
00:16:43,764 --> 00:16:45,864
Mm-hmm. Turned you both down.

207
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:48,797
Whatever, so the question's
for both of you then...

208
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:50,697
What was your reasoning?

209
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:52,764
She said...

210
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:55,264
[both] "I just don't like men
who are shorter than me."

211
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,831
Ahhhhh!!!

212
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,231
You can't judge a man
for something he can't help!

213
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:04,297
Uhhh.. I don't really see
how this has anything to do

214
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:06,764
with getting Al's body back.

215
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,285
I had to be sure...

216
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:13,085
Al had a memory of
something I don't recall...

217
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:16,118
And you seem to clearly remember
it the same way, Winry...

218
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,718
Which means that it
happened without a doubt...

219
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:21,085
So now that we know you
remembered something real...

220
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:23,118
then we also
know for a fact...

221
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:25,751
that really is Al
bonded in there.

222
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:29,851
I pulled you out, Al.
I actually did it.

223
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:33,051
I know it was only your
soul, but that's just it.

224
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,451
If I was able to pull
that much of you out...

225
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:36,785
then I've got a hunch...

226
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:39,785
that your body's still in
there and I can pull <i>it</i> out.

227
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:41,885
You think my body's
still in the portal...

228
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:44,451
existing separately
from my soul?

229
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:47,185
[Al gasps] Like Barry's body!

230
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:52,818
Right! What did you see?
Try to think back...

231
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:56,051
Can you remember what happened
when the Truth unraveled you?

232
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:00,718
[Al] I reached out...

233
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:06,318
And it was me! It was
my hand I grabbed!

234
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,085
I knew it!
Doesn't look like

235
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:10,051
we're done with
the Truth yet, Al.

236
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,718
We're gonna get in there
and pull your body out!

237
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,751
Brother!

238
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,118
After the portal.. I
remember looking at you

239
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:21,818
from inside that thing.
The thing we thought was Mom!

240
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:25,351
You were inside of it?
That thing was you?

241
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:28,418
I guess so.. But my
soul didn't bind.

242
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:31,051
It must've rejected
me right away.

243
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:36,685
So that means.. We didn't harm
anyone else's soul after all.

244
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,785
[knock on door]

245
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,218
[Bellhop] Mr. Elric?

246
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:44,451
You have a telephone
call from Izumi Curtis.

247
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:47,451
[Izumi] I did some research...

248
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:49,951
Sig and I looked up
our family lines...

249
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:55,018
And well... The child that
I transmuted.. It couldn't...

250
00:18:55,018 --> 00:18:56,818
It didn't have a
single physical trait

251
00:18:56,818 --> 00:19:00,051
that could've come from us.

252
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:02,051
You're on to
something, aren't you?

253
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:04,185
Yes.. I've come
to the conclusion

254
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,918
that death is permanent.

255
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:12,051
So not even transmutation
can change that fact.

256
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:16,785
All this time.. I thought that
I must've missed something...

257
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:20,085
but it was impossible
to do in the first place.

258
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:22,318
Ed!

259
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:25,251
Yes, ma'am?!

260
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:26,485
Thank you.

261
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:28,251
[phone is hung up]

262
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:33,785
[Al] So what did
Teacher have to say?

263
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:38,985
Well I'm not really sure why...
But she said.. thank you.

264
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:50,185
Al?

265
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:52,418
This entire time
I've been blaming

266
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:55,718
myself for what happened.

267
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:57,451
I thought it was me.

268
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:01,285
I thought I was the one
who killed Mom a second time.

269
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:05,485
And so did I.. Al.

270
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:08,351
Thanks, Brother...
Thank you...

271
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:11,818
I wasn't the one who
killed Mom after all!

272
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:17,018
Izumi.

273
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:20,151
I feel like I've been
brought back to life.

274
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:24,351
Our child wasn't made to
suffer twice because of me...

275
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:29,218
[Ed] But still... None
of this changes the fact

276
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:31,918
that I'm the one who
put you in that body...

277
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:33,418
And I don't care
what it takes...

278
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:35,051
I'm gonna make
you normal agai-

279
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:37,751
Brother... I was
right there with you

280
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,485
and I knew that
there were risks...

281
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:43,718
so quit trying to shoulder
all of this on your own.

282
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:46,185
I can't watch you
suffer like this.

283
00:20:46,185 --> 00:20:48,918
Not on your own...
I can't just stand back

284
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:52,018
and watch other people
get hurt over what I've done.

285
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:54,351
Like what happened
to Mr. Hughes!

286
00:20:56,351 --> 00:21:00,251
I felt like it was my fault
when I found out he was dead...

287
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,785
And I told myself that
if it meant other people

288
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:06,085
getting hurt, then I don't
even want my body back.

289
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:10,951
Brother...

290
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:14,151
I've met other people
who weren't exactly human...

291
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:17,418
but they still managed to live
their lives with a purpose.

292
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:21,418
And even in this body.. It
hasn't stopped other people

293
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:24,385
from treating me like
I'm still human.

294
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:27,185
This body could
reject me anytime...

295
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,951
But it's the same
with being human.

296
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:32,351
You never know when you might
get sick or die in an accident.

297
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:34,851
So I can still get
by like this...

298
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:37,251
I can live a somewhat
normal life...

299
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:41,918
And that's how I've managed
to keep going.. But now...

300
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:44,251
I can't take it anymore.

301
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:52,185
Because... I can't...

302
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:55,085
I can't take all the
nights by myself!

303
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,118
It's too lonely...

304
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:01,851
And that's why I have
to get back to normal.

305
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:04,818
Sure.. And you're going to.

306
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:08,118
We'll knock that Truth
jerk on his butt!

307
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,018
And then we're gonna pull your
body right outta that place!

308
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:12,951
[Al] Yeah!

309
00:22:22,118 --> 00:22:24,918
[Winry] Huh?

310
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:30,218
<i>That's weird. Have his
