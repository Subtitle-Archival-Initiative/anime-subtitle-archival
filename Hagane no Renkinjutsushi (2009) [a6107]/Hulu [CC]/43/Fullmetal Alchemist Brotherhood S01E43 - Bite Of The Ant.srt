1
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:16,224
Kimblee...! Where are you?

2
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:21,581
This... this shouldn't
be happening...!

3
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:22,914
You guaranteed victory.

4
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:24,081
What happened to the turncoats

5
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:26,648
who would attack
from the inside?!

6
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:34,548
[BRIGGS SOLDIER A]
Cease fire, men!

7
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,581
[BUCCANEER]
That was too easy.

8
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,148
[MILES]
Yeah.

9
00:00:41,348 --> 00:00:43,048
But why?

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,748
The crest is carved.

11
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,850
[MAY CHANG]
You aren't listening!

12
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,917
I told you...

13
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:40,917
Alkahestry is all about
reading the dragon's pulse!

14
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:42,650
[AL]
And I told you...

15
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,683
I have no idea
what that even means!

16
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:47,250
[MAY CHANG] Clear your mind
and think with your senses!

17
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,617
Like this...!
See, it's easy!

18
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:50,850
You're just pointing!

19
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,317
[MAY CHANG]
No, I'm focusing!

20
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:54,283
[AL] Can't you explain
it scientifically?

21
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:55,783
[MAN 1]
They're rambunctious, huh?

22
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:56,850
Yeah, no kidding...

23
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,517
Sorry to impose on you.

24
00:02:58,517 --> 00:02:59,817
You're not imposing...

25
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:02,817
You're actually helping us out.

26
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:07,583
Ow! Stop pulling
my hair, you brat!

27
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,517
[MAN 1] You guys are a welcome
distraction for our kids.

28
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:15,617
We're gonna head out
to find some firewood.

29
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:18,350
Would you mind letting
Zampano know for me?

30
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,350
[YOKI]
Damn it!

31
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,917
Evil little children...!

32
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,483
And where the hell is Zampano?

33
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:29,150
Why does he get to wander
off while I get tortured?!

34
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:36,517
Hey!

35
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:42,583
[ZAMPANO]
They're close by... Follow me.

36
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,283
You lead the way... Zampano.

37
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,796
[BRADLEY] So I hear
that you've discovered

38
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:56,896
Selim's true identity.

39
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:58,630
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,163
And you're also
aware of who I am?

41
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:02,730
Yes.

42
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,330
Lieutenant...

43
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,896
I'm interested in
hearing your opinion

44
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:10,363
as a loyal citizen
of this country...

45
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:14,630
How do you feel about your
leader being a Homunculus?

46
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,596
I think it's sad the
family I've answered to

47
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,763
and trusted isn't real...

48
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:21,130
That you don't
even have that much.

49
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,363
[HAWKEYE]
You're just putting on an act...

50
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:28,763
Pretending to be the
humans you secretly despise.

51
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:30,763
[BRADLEY] It is true
that Selim was appointed

52
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:33,463
to be my son by my superior.

53
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:35,830
Everything from my
power down to my rank

54
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,763
was appointed to me...

55
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:41,496
Most of my life is just an act.

56
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:45,196
But my wife, at least,
was of my own choosing.

57
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,730
Are you finished with the tea?

58
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,563
Uh, yessir.

59
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,830
Delicious. Thank you.

60
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:08,830
[GERSO]
Are you serious, Doctor?

61
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,663
You were one of the
bigwig researchers

62
00:05:10,663 --> 00:05:11,896
at the Fifth Labratory?

63
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:13,530
I wasn't that important...

64
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,363
I just had a few
men working for me.

65
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,530
It's been ages since I've
spoken with any of them.

66
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,807
[ZAMPANO]
Hey!

67
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:30,596
Who is this man with you?

68
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,796
He's just a, uh,
nice drifter I met.

69
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:34,230
He was hoping
you might be able

70
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,796
to examine him, Doctor.

71
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,630
You can stop, Zampano.

72
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,596
Nobody's falling
for your bad acting.

73
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:44,296
It's nice to see you, Doctor...

74
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:46,363
It's been too long...

75
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:48,430
I like what you've
done with your face.

76
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,363
Now who do you think you are...?

77
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:54,730
You honestly believed you
could pull one over on me?

78
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,296
[ENVY]
What is this?!

79
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:03,230
Zampano!

80
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,296
Now what were you
saying about my acting...?

81
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:06,496
It's bad?

82
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:07,630
Thank you, Envy...

83
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,530
You couldn't have made

84
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,396
our plans to lure
you here any easier.

85
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:13,630
You did just as we expected...

86
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,830
You take such
delight in your cruelty...

87
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,230
I knew you'd come to
capture me on your own.

88
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,196
Well you were right
about that one, Doctor...

89
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:23,430
And now that you've
got me here...

90
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,896
You asked for i-- Ahhh!!

91
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,530
What do you think, Envy...?

92
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,263
They're like landmines
loaded with alchemy.

93
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:36,430
That kind of alchemy
doesn't even exist!

94
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:44,230
Dammit...! You say
they're landmines?

95
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,363
Then all I've gotta do is

96
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,696
follow your
footsteps to avoid them.

97
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,863
Ahhhhhhhhh!!

98
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:53,196
What the hell?!

99
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:57,930
They're set to detonate
for Homunculi only.

100
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,163
We've littered the
entire area with them,

101
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:02,596
all hidden beneath the snow.

102
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:03,696
Well, Envy...

103
00:07:03,696 --> 00:07:06,430
How does it feel to have
the tables turned on you...?

104
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,896
It's not as much fun
on that side, is it?

105
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:12,896
It's working perfectly.

106
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:16,130
He doesn't know it's
remote alkahestry.

107
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:20,296
[ENVY]
That's enough.

108
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:22,630
You should've just
done as you were told...

109
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,596
But if you scum
really want to test me...

110
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:27,396
then I'll show
you who's in charge!

111
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:41,296
[roars]

112
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:48,230
Doctor!

113
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,830
That was a close one!

114
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,830
Th... thank you.

115
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,830
You're fast for a fat boy.

116
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:04,463
You shouldn't
underestimate us "scum."

117
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:07,263
Dammit!

118
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:12,463
If you think you're
gonna win this...

119
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:15,230
You're fools!

120
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,730
[SCAR]
Is that so?

121
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:18,396
Now then...

122
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,463
What do you think of this?

123
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:28,196
[ENVY roars]

124
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,696
Is he dead?

125
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:37,730
Doctor!

126
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,563
Ha ha! I gotcha!

127
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:41,630
Doctor!

128
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,330
Whoa... Stay put...

129
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,563
Unless you want him dead...

130
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:46,930
Now then.

131
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,263
How should I punish you?

132
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,263
What do you think, Doctor...?

133
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:56,163
How about I wipe out a
village of innocent people?

134
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:59,125
[MARCOH] I'm not
gonna let you do that.

135
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,563
Quit trying to resist, Marcoh...

136
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:06,536
It just looks stupid.

137
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,263
There we go...

138
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,763
That slum is ripe
for destruction.

139
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:19,230
Don't do it!

140
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,563
But it would be wasteful
to simply kill them...

141
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:24,496
I could always take them
back to Central instead...

142
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:27,563
We are running
low on ingredients.

143
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:28,796
Monster...!

144
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:31,830
You're still using souls to
make Philosopher's Stones...?!

145
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,163
I won't let you...!

146
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:36,430
Let my research team go, dammit!

147
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,563
Huh...? Oh Sorry.

148
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:39,530
It's a little too
late to release them

149
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,563
now that we've turned them
into Philosopher's Stones.

150
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:47,630
You... You sacrificed my men?

151
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,763
What...? I forgot
to tell you...?

152
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:51,830
Oh, well, Doctor...

153
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,596
There's no point in crying
over spilled milk, now.

154
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,596
It's not right for
you to get so upset

155
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,730
considering all the
Stones you've made.

156
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,430
And all the lives
you put into them.

157
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:12,596
[MARCOH]
You're right...

158
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:14,763
I've sacrificed
many innocent lives

159
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:18,230
to make your damned
Philosopher's Stones...

160
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,730
I know better
than anyone else

161
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,730
how much pain goes
into creating them.

162
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,763
And not only do I know
how to create them...

163
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:29,130
But I know how to
destroy them as well!

It hurts so much...!

So much pain!

No, this can't happen!

It can't!

This can't be... No...

How can this...
How can this happen?

177
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:40,360
I could never be defeated

00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:49,193
Don't... Quit looking at me...

181
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:51,227
How dare you look at me.

182
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:54,760
Don't look down
on me you worms!

183
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:03,260
Don't look... down
on... me... worms.

184
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:05,860
How pathetic...

185
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,627
This is the thing that
caused so much damage?

186
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:13,327
[labored breathing]

187
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:17,927
[SCAR]
We did it, Marcoh... We won.

188
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:28,393
Oh...! Hey look!
Here they come!

189
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,660
[WINRY]
Dr. Marcoh...!

190
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,993
Are you okay,
what happened?!

191
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:35,860
What's that?

192
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:40,660
Whooaa...

193
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,727
[YOKI]
I can't believe you guys

194
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:45,427
would keep me in
the dark about this.

195
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:46,327
That's what you get

196
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,060
for picking a fight
with us humans...

197
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Grotesque tadpole.

198
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,927
Look at you...

199
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:53,693
Why would you do
something so dangerous?

200
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:55,127
Because I had to...

201
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:57,960
I've always done
what I was told to do.

202
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,427
I had to take a risk and
think for myself this time...

203
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:03,193
I put my fear aside...

204
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:05,727
and did what was right...

205
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:08,760
I wanted to be
like your parents.

206
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,427
You were... But try
not to be so reckless.

207
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,993
Sure.

208
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:21,393
[YOKI]
Yowww!

209
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:23,993
Mr. Yoki?

210
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:27,127
Help... Get it off me.

211
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:29,860
I've hijacked this idiot's body!

212
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,260
[YOKI]
Stop it! Let go...!

213
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,393
Somebody help me...!

214
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:36,060
I can't control my body!

215
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,827
That's right, you can't.

216
00:13:37,827 --> 00:13:38,860
[ENVY]
Now if you want him to live,

217
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,260
you'll do as I tell you.

218
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,660
[GERSO]
Nah, he's all yours.

219
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,760
Do what you want.

220
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,027
[ZAMPANO] It's not like
he's our friend or anything.

221
00:13:46,027 --> 00:13:46,827
Poor Yoki...

222
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,827
I'm sorry I didn't
know you better.

223
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,993
[AL] We'll never
forget your sacrifice.

224
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:54,427
Ahhhhh!!!
Please, Mr. Scar...

225
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:55,127
You won't stand back

226
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,993
and let this thing kill me...!

227
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:58,627
Right?

228
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,727
How can you turn
your back on me?!

229
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:04,460
After all that I've done...

230
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,927
[ENVY]
Wh... What is this...?

231
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:07,093
Doesn't anyone
care about this guy?

232
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:09,293
[MARCOH]
You're wasting your time, Envy.

233
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:11,827
We've accepted the
measures we'll have to take

234
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:12,993
to defeat you...

235
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:14,360
We'll destroy both you

236
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,927
and this man if
you don't surrender.

237
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:19,693
[ENVY]
Dammit.

238
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,427
[AL]
Got him.

239
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,660
I'm free?

240
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,827
[GERSO]
Nice acting, Doctor.

241
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:28,993
I'm afraid I'm not used
to bluffing like that.

242
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,260
Damn all of you...!

243
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,227
None of you guys
are my friends...!

244
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:34,860
How could you?
You're dead to me!

245
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,193
[ENVY]
This sucks.

246
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:41,160
[GERSO] So... This seems
like a good opportunity

247
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,127
to interrogate you.

248
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:45,793
I'm not talking.

249
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,327
Spit it out! You slug...!

250
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:49,127
You're either gonna talk or die!

251
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:52,093
That's it...!
Let him have it, Zampano!

252
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:58,127
Even if I do talk, you're
still gonna kill me...

253
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:00,393
So what's the point...? Fool.

254
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:02,260
What?

255
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,227
So what's the deal...?

256
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:05,793
Why isn't the Fullmetal
pipsqueak with you?

257
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:06,660
[AL]
Brother...?

258
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,827
I'm pretty sure
he's at Briggs by now.

259
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,727
Last thing that I heard,
he had gone missing.

260
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:15,827
[AL]
What'd you say...?!

261
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:16,993
He's missing?

262
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:17,793
Tell me!

263
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,260
He disappeared
after a mine shaft

264
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,093
in Baschool collapsed...

265
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:23,760
I wonder if he's still alive?

266
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,537
[WINRY] He's lying...
He has to be.

267
00:15:36,432 --> 00:15:37,665
[GERSO]
So what now?

268
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:41,532
Should we head back
to Baschool to check?

269
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:44,698
[AL] No... That's not
what Brother would want.

270
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:46,398
He would trust
that I was alright

271
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:49,132
and wouldn't let a
rumor stop him...

272
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:53,132
So we're gonna do the
same thing and keep moving.

273
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:56,732
We can't give up hope yet.

274
00:15:56,732 --> 00:16:00,132
[SCAR]
I'll go my separate way for now.

275
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:03,198
I've realized something
about the actions I've taken...

276
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:05,798
I don't intend to
simply punish this country

277
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,432
for what it did to Ishval.

278
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:10,465
I want to change it.

279
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:12,432
And I'll need
your help, Marcoh...

280
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:15,565
The two of us need
to set things right.

281
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:20,632
Alright then...
We'll travel together.

282
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:23,332
In order to change
this country...

283
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:24,398
[AL]
Actually...

284
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:26,665
I've got someplace I've
been meaning to check out.

285
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:28,232
[GERSO]
Oh...? Where's that?

286
00:16:28,232 --> 00:16:31,632
[AL] It's a town called
Liore... I'm not sure...

287
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:34,598
But I've got a feeling
the tunnel runs under it.

288
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:35,565
[SCAR]
Here, May...

289
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:38,832
Take this thing and
return to your country.

290
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,032
Hold on!

291
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,532
It's the remnants of a seemingly
indestructible creature...

292
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:46,665
It might appease your emperor
enough to save your clan.

293
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:47,765
I can't...!

294
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,632
Who's gonna teach you
about alkahestry if I leave?

295
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:52,398
[SCAR] You need to think
about your own country.

296
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:55,265
Have you forgotten why you
came here in the first place...?

297
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,598
Your clan could lose
its power struggle...

298
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,132
And what explanation
will you have

299
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:00,698
for them when you return home?

300
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:02,232
Will you apologize and tell them

301
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:06,632
you were too busy
saving another country?

302
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:08,532
Now go home...

303
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:09,832
Forget this place...

304
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:12,398
Leave this country's
problems to its people.

305
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:28,498
Thank you, for everything!

306
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:36,365
[AL]
You take care, May...

307
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:38,532
Once I learn the
basics of Alkahestry...

308
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:40,732
I'll be sure to find
you to learn more.

309
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:43,032
[MAY CHANG]
Oh, Alphonse.

310
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,565
Alphonse... I'll...
I'll miss you.

311
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:53,732
Good luck...!

312
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:56,298
I'll never forget
any of you...!

313
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:58,332
Thank you...! Goodbye.

314
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:02,765
[WINRY]
Have a safe journey, May!

315
00:18:05,298 --> 00:18:08,365
[AL]
There she goes.

316
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,132
[MARCOH]
We should start moving as well.

317
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,698
[SCAR]
Let's go.

318
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:29,032
[sniffles]
Poor Mr. Greed...

319
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,398
[SOLDIER 1]
No luck...

320
00:18:37,398 --> 00:18:38,532
Izumi Curtis and her husband

321
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:40,065
are apparently on vacation

322
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:42,065
and didn't say when
they're returning.

323
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:44,565
[SOLDIER 2]
Hmm... Is that so?

324
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:46,698
We should report back
to Fuhrer Bradley...

325
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:49,565
There's not much
else we can do.

326
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:51,046
<i>[BIDO]
Bradley!</i>

327
00:18:56,765 --> 00:19:01,232
[BRADLEY] Now you stay
put, I'll be right back.

328
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:02,798
[SOLDIER 2] He might
have replacements for us.

329
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,298
Let's hope so.

330
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:08,498
<i>[BIDO] I might find
Mr. Greed if I follow them...</i>

331
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:10,132
<i>But...</i>

332
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:31,532
Uh, Sis?

333
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:32,432
Would you be so kind

334
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:35,198
as to possibly move
your foot, please?

335
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,398
[OLIVIER] You are to
address me as General!

336
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:40,665
Yes, ma'am, General!

337
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:43,665
You're just as gutless
as I remember you being.

338
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:44,398
So...

339
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:45,365
I heard your men

340
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:47,465
completely annihilated
the Drachma forces.

341
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,232
Of course they did!

342
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,665
But won't that hasten

343
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:53,532
the enemy's
transmutation circle?

344
00:19:53,532 --> 00:19:54,832
I don't give a damn.

345
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:57,632
It was their duty to
defend the border...

346
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:59,565
And that's what they did...

347
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,198
And Drachma won't
even think twice

348
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:02,732
about attacking again.

349
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:04,332
Now they know that Our country

350
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:06,798
is not one to be meddled with.

351
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:09,332
Oh, my, you've only
grown more ferocious...

352
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:13,698
How will you ever find a
husband if you continue to--

353
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:16,198
That's enough of your
sniveling, you pansy!

354
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,532
I need to get
away from you

355
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,698
before I start to
catch your cowardice.

356
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:22,598
[GARDNER]
Ah...

357
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,265
I've been looking
for you, General...

358
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,332
Is this man your brother?

359
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:30,065
I don't consider
him my brother...

360
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:34,232
Not after he deserted
his country in Ishval.

361
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,532
Follow me, please...

362
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:38,032
There's something I'd
like for you to see.

363
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,565
[GARDNER]
Are you familiar

364
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:45,365
with the three state-appointed
tenets of alchemy?

365
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:46,665
Of course...

366
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:48,165
"Obey the military"...

367
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,532
"Do not create gold"...

368
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:51,132
"Do not create people"...

369
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:52,132
And that's it.

370
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:53,365
You know them well.

371
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:56,198
[GARDNER] Obeying the military
should go without saying...

372
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:57,698
The creation of
gold is restricted

373
00:20:57,698 --> 00:21:00,265
to avoid financial disorder.

374
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:01,398
So then...

375
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:03,265
What about creating people...?

376
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:04,565
Why do you suppose the state

377
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,532
would so firmly
enforce this regulation?

378
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,532
[OLIVIER]
It's simply unethical, sir...

379
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:12,098
It's even taboo
amongst alchemists...

380
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:13,198
From what I understand,

381
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:16,365
they regard it as an
implicit sacrilege against God.

382
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:18,432
[GARDNER]
But that isn't why.

383
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:22,665
The state has no
interest in ethics...

384
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:27,632
They're too much of a
variable to use as a guideline.

385
00:21:27,632 --> 00:21:31,698
The true reason is
far less abstract.

386
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:33,665
The third tenet is
to prevent someone

387
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:37,298
from creating their
own army... General.

388
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:10,432
[ZAMPANO]
This place is a disaster.

389
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,698
[GERSO] You think there's
anyplace left standing

390
00:23:11,698 --> 00:23:13,532
where we could get
something to eat?

391
00:23:13,532 --> 00:23:14,665
[AL]
I think so...

392
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:16,532
It's around here somewhere.

393
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:20,498
[AL]
Rose...! How are you?

394
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:21,765
What a surprise...!

395
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:22,765
So, Al...

396
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:24,665
What brings you
back to Liore?

397
00:23:24,665 --> 00:23:26,732
[GERSO] Looks like the kid
knows her, doesn't he?

398
00:23:26,732 --> 00:23:27,398
[AL]
Huh...?

399
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:28,765
Yeah, somewhat.

400
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:29,565
[ROSE]
Hey, Al...

401
00:23:29,565 --> 00:23:30,532
Where's Ed...?

402
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:32,132
Isn't he with you?

403
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:33,098
[AL]
Uh...

404
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:35,498
No, we're traveling
separately right now.

405
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,398
Oh... that's too bad...

406
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:40,465
I've actually really missed him.

407
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,298
[AL]
Winry?

408
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,598
Wh... What, Al?

409
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:46,598
[AL]
Oh, nothing!

410
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,232
You just kind of had a
funny look on your face,

411
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:49,098
that's all.

412
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:51,398
I did not! You're
imagining things!

413
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:52,598
Okay, Rose...

414
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,832
These pots are as
clean as they get...

415
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:56,498
You have anything el--

416
00:23:56,498 --> 00:23:57,665
[ROSE laughs]

417
00:23:57,665 --> 00:23:59,298
[AL] Huh?

418
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,798
[HOHENHEIM, AL and WINRY gasp]
