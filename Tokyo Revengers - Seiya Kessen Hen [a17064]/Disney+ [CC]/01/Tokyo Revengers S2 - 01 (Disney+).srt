{\an8}(intense music)

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,594
KISAKI: How's it feel to be entrusted
with the fate of Toman?

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,140
- Don't worry.
-(Takemichi gasping)

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,475
{\an8}You'll be joining him soon enough.

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,686
{\an8}(whimpering)

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,812
{\an8}(grumbles)

8
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,359
{\an8}What the hell is wrong with you?

9
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,527
(Takemichi gasps)

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,321
Is that all you've got?

11
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,205
{\an8}KISAKI: How disappointing.

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,875
{\an8}(grunting)

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,754
So long...

14
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,632
{\an8}my hero.

15
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,177
(clanks)

16
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,636
MAN: What the hell?

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,513
-(thumping)
-(man grunting)

18
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,681
(body thuds)

19
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,815
(Takemichi gasps)

20
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,320
(soft gasp)

21
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,741
(gasps)

22
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:18,453
(panting)

23
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,708
TAKEMICHI: <i>Where am I?</i>

24
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,710
(grunting)

25
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,462
Shit!

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,801
TAKEMICHI: <i>That's right!
Kisaki shot me in the leg.</i>

27
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,803
<i>Wait...</i>

28
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,848
<i>But after that, someone...</i>

29
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,600
KAZUTORA: I gave you first aid.

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,851
What?

31
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,770
(dramatic music)

32
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,230
(wind blowing)

33
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,148
(gasps)

34
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,652
TAKEMICHI: Baji?

35
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,992
TOKYO REVENGERS

36
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,412
{\an8}(gasps)

37
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,081
{\an8}TAKEMICHI: <i>No.</i>

38
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,625
{\an8}(gasps)

39
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,091
Kazutora...

40
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,009
(earring clinking)

41
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,012
{\an8}TAKEMICHI: <i>Oh, right.</i>

42
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,598
{\an8}<i>It's been 12 years, so he's out of prison.</i>

43
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,687
{\an8}(grunting)

44
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,148
{\an8}It's been a while...

45
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,232
{\an8}(groans)

46
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,651
Kazutora...

47
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,821
(grunting)

48
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,282

00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,747
(grunting stops)

51
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,167
The other day,

52
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,129
some guys were beating the crap
out of a chick like this in the street.

53
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,631
(breathes heavily)

54
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:59,804
When I jumped in to break it up,
they said they were members of Toman.

55
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:06,436
When did your Toman
turn into a gang that beats on women?

56
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,940
I don't give a shit about you.

57
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,696
It was...

58
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,657
Chifuyu I wanted to save.

59
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,577
(soft gasp)

60
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,666
(car approaching)

61
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,338
-(car horn honks)
-(soft gasp)

62
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,925
It's you...

63
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,345
It's been a while, Kazutora.

64
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,848
- Need a ride?
-(gasps)

65
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,934
(car engine revs)

66
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,105
CHIFUYU: Toman has gone to the dogs.

67
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,985
They're a criminal gang with zero ethics,
and the cops can't touch them.

68
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,573
I want us to turn Toman back
into what it used to be.

69
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,913
He'd been fighting all alone
this whole time.

70
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,291
But you...

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,961
What the hell were you doing?

72
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,462
(gasps)

73
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,799
TAKEMICHI: <i>I get it now.</i>

74
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,343
<i>In this timeline,</i>

75
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,763
<i>I ended up so rotten,
Chifuyu couldn't rely on me.</i>

76
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,684
KAZUTORA:
Toman got so big, it lost its way.

77
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,646
Still, you guys were the first
to serve as Kisaki's lackeys.

78
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,022
(sighs)

79
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,193
Draken, our only hope,
ended up on death row.

80
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,655
<i>And nobody knows where Mikey is now.</i>

81
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,908
So, Takemichi,

82
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,328
where is Toman headed?

83
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:53,960
Remember how Mikey once said
he'd build a new era for hoodlums?

84
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,717
Just like he said, Toman has gotten huge.

85
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:06,889
Drug dealing, prostitution,
illegal casinos, loansharking, murder.

86
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,810
Toman does every kind of crime
and has grown huge doing it.

87
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,480
But... But...

88
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,318
Is this the era that
Mikey wanted to build?

89
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,072
Is this the Toman that
Baji wanted to protect?

90
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,282
(gasps)

91
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,162
So, I'm going to build
a new era for hoodlums.

92
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,543
I want a gang

93
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,920
where each of us is
willing to risk our lives

94
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,131
for each other.

95
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:46,054
KAZUTORA: Back then, this wasn't the kind
of Toman they wanted to build.

96
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,140
Isn't that right, Takemichi?

97
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,310
TAKEMICHI: <i>He's right!</i>

98
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,770
<i>It's not!</i>

99
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,731
It's not!

100
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,778
The Toman I loved wasn't like this!

101
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,906
It was always something to be proud of!

102
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,741
Yes.

103
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,995
KAZUTORA: Let's take back our Toman.

104
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,209
-(Takemichi groans)
-(car door closes)

105
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,128
Kazutora, I...

106
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,090
I don't really remember things well,

107
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,426
so I might ask some weird questions.

108
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,763
How did Toman end up like this?

109
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,056
(soft grunt)

110
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,516
Well, I mean...

111
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,437
I'm still kind of in shock,
so my head is pretty fuzzy.

112
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,065
- It was Mikey.
- What?

113
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,359
Mikey changed completely.

114
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,699
Toman changed because Mikey changed.

115
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,701
It can't be!

116
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,079
Someone else must be behind it!

117
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,832
Isn't Kisaki pulling
the strings or something?

118
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,335
A month ago, Mitsuya went missing.

119
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,711
Oh?

120
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,881
Mikey sent for him,
but he hasn't been seen since then.

121
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,841
What?

122
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,551
(cell phone ringing)

123
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,431
Hello?

124
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,352
I see.

125
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,316
While Kisaki had you tied up last night,

126
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,111
- Pah-chin and Peh-yan were murdered.
-(gasps)

127
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,115
(foreboding music)

128
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:33,703
This means Mikey has started
purging the old Toman members.

129
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,915
-(breathes shakily)
- He doesn't trust his old friends anymore.

130
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,125
It can't be...

131
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,587
How could Mikey do that to everyone?

132
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,631
It's all being done at Mikey's command.

133
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,676
Kisaki is just carrying out the orders.

134
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,888
<i>Mikey has gone truly evil.</i>

135
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,893
As one of the people who changed him,

136
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,728
I want to talk to him.

137
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,355
He needs to get away from them!

138
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,858
"Them"?

139
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,610
KAZUTORA: <i>The violence of Kisaki</i>

140
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,820
<i>and the money of BLACK DRAGON.</i>

141
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,323
<i>Unless something is done about them,</i>

142
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,202
- Mikey will never return to normal.
-(soft gasp)

143
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,370
He's not a hoodlum anymore.

144
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,247
(beeps)

145
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,958
Help me out, Takemichi.

146
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,544
It's my turn to help Mikey now.

147
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,379
I want to save Manjiro Sano.

148
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,672
(soft grunt)

149
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,975
The remnants of the old biker gang,
BLACK DRAGON,

150
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:43,356
joined up with Toman and
became Mikey's heavy hitters.

151
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,858
Those guys will do anything for money.

152
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,901
Well...

153
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,614
Wasn't BLACK DRAGON
the reason why Toman was formed?

154
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,573
That's right.

155
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,826
I had connections with
BLACK DRAGON in the past.

156
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,163
But they're definitely
not like they used to be.

157
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,377
The mounds of cash they can produce are
one of the things that corrupted Mikey.

158
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,130
I used my connections
to find their hidden bank account.

159
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,842
I plan to solve this
by stopping the flow of that money.

160
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:19,016
And the one who was going
to handle Kisaki, Mikey's right-hand man,

161
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,643
was Chifuyu.

162
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,734
KAZUTORA: Chifuyu was killed because
he'd backed Kisaki into a corner.

163
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,819
Really?

164
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,281
That's why I went to that
building to rescue Chifuyu.

165
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,324
How did Chifuyu...

166
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,244
How did he have Kisaki cornered?

167
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,497
One day, a police detective approached us.

168
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,498
What?

169
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,459
KAZUTORA: He's the brother of a woman
Kisaki had murdered.

170
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,669
(gasps)

171
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,255
I want revenge.

172
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,090
TAKEMICHI: <i>That's Naoto!</i>

173
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,219
Wait! You mean you and Chifuyu
helped that detective?

174
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,137
Yeah.

175
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,682
We looked into the murder
of Hinata Tachibana.

176
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,602
We figured out who gave the orders.

177
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,648
Atsushi Sendo, a Toman member,
rammed a car into a microcar

178
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,611
driven by a school teacher.
They caught fire and blew up.

179
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,696
They both died in that accident.

180
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,531
You remember it, right?

181
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,909
TAKEMICHI: <i>It's seared into my memory!</i>

182
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,662
KAZUTORA: Kisaki gave the order.

183
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,874
But he has an alibi.

184
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,502
He was meeting with you guys
in the top brass that day.

185
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,503
What?

186
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,005
TAKEMICHI: <i>He was meeting with us?</i>

187
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,635
<i>That must mean in this timeline
when Hinata and Akkun died,</i>

188
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,720
<i>I wasn't even there.</i>

189
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,973
But Chifuyu had proof...

190
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,769
that it was Kisaki who gave the order.

191
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,062
Proof?

192
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,776
We had Kisaki cornered
and were on the verge of getting him.

193
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:57,782
But it's Chifuyu's fault
for letting him slip through our fingers.

194
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,367
-(brake squeals)
- What?

195
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,328
Get out, Takemichi.

196
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,665
KAZUTORA: There's a guy in that alley
I want you to see.

197
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,791
TAKEMICHI: Me?

198
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,337
(Takemichi grunts)

199
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,590
(grunts)

200
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,511
TAKEMICHI: <i>He wants me to see someone?</i>

201
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,179
<i>Who could it be?</i>

202
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,893
(gasps)

203
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,144
TAKEMICHI: Naoto!

204
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,523
<i>I've found him at last!</i>

205
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,069
I've been waiting for you,

206
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,696
Takemichi.

207
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,155
Naoto...

208
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,907
(handcuffs rattle)

209
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,618
TAKEMICHI: What?

210
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,954
Takemichi Hanagaki,

211
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:49,083
I'm placing you under arrest
for instigating murder!

212
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,084
What?

213
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,420
NAOTO: I'm sorry, Hanemiya.

214
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,422
(grunts)
You bastard!

215
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:59,218
I'm under arrest... for murder?

216
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,972
Too bad, Takemichi.

217
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,182
Naoto...

218
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,350
Why?

219
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,106
Watch this.

220
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,943
TAKEMICHI: That's Chifuyu.

221
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,071
What's this a video of?

222
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,991
(door opens in video)

223
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,077
-(door closes in video)
- CHIFUYU: <i>Good afternoon.</i>

224
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,203
HAKKAI: <i>You too.</i>

225
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,292
<i>It's sure as hell hot.</i>
(exhales deeply)

226
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,044
<i>Go on, sit down.</i>

227
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,007
<i>I didn't want
to have to call you about this,</i>

228
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,633
<i>but it was ordered.</i>

229
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,635
<i>We got no choice.</i>

230
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,597
Is that... me?

231
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,933
NAOTO:
Chifuyu Matsuno secretly taped this.

232
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:49,894
(grunts)

233
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,359
I don't know how to explain this.

234
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,903
But in any case,

235
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,656
as always, the moment
you returned to the present,

236
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,950
my timeline changed in an instant.

237
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,205
The changes you made in the past
made big changes in the present.

238
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,458
I'm still a cop, just as before.

239
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,544
But you don't work
at a rental shop this time.

240
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,338
You're a bigwig in Toman.

241
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,966
Yet, just like before,

242
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,928
on August 10th,

243
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,098
my sister was killed in her car
by Atsushi Sendo.

244
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:34,188
Then, I teamed up
with Kazutora Hanemiya and Chifuyu Matsuno

245
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,941
to arrest Kisaki for my sister's death.

246
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,317
(Takemichi breathes heavily)

247
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,277
I'm sorry, Takemichi.

248
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,404
You must be in shock.

249
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:47,117
Considering my position,
I had no choice but to arrest you.

250
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,538
Watch the rest of the video.

251
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,705
- Okay...
-(clicks)

252
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,875
<i>There's only one reason I call you here.</i>

253
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,711
<i>I want you to kill someone.</i>

254
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,879
MAN: <i>Who?</i>

255
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,967
<i>I don't know who it is.
I couldn't care less either!</i>

256
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:07,847
<i>What's important is that
they're a nuisance to Toman!</i>

257
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,141
<i>It's not like I want to make you do this.</i>

258
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,311
<i>If it's not done,
Kisaki will be on my ass.</i>

259
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,772
<i>Got it, Atsushi?</i>

260
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,482
(gasps)
Atsushi?

261
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,442
That's Akkun!

262
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,279
AKKUN: <i>Who am I supposed to kill?</i>

263
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,239
TAKEMICHI (in video):
<i>I told you! I don't know!</i>

264
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,660
<i>Someone will contact
you with the details later.</i>

265
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,705
<i>We'll get you everything
you need to do it.</i>

266
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,623
- AKKUN: <i>Actually...</i>
- TAKEMICHI (in video): <i>What's it?</i>

267
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,001
AKKUN: <i>I haven't heard from my wife
since last night.</i>

268
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:37,960
TAKEMICHI (in video): <i>What?</i>

269
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,754
AKKUN: <i>Come on, Takemichi!
Talk to the bosses for me!</i>

270
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,548
<i>My wife is pregnant with our second...</i>

271
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,716
TAKEMICHI: <i>Shut up!</i>

272
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,219
<i>It's your duty as a plebe
to do what you're told, goddamn it!</i>

273
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,097
I ordered Akkun...

274
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,683
to kill someone?

275
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,353
Here is another video.

276
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,939
Chifuyu Matsuno secretly taped this too.

277
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,941
Watch it carefully.

278
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,610
-(yelling in video)
-(gasps)

279
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,904
(yells)

280
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,614
CHIFUYU: <i>Cut it out, Takemichi!</i>

281
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,615
TAKEMICHI: <i>Fuck off!</i>

282
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,658
CHIFUYU:
<i>Destroying the furniture won't help!</i>

283
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,744
<i>Goddamn it! I was set up!</i>

284
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,204
<i>That Kisaki is the devil!</i>

285
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:19,251
<i>I didn't know he was supposed to kill her!</i>

286
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,794
(Takemichi sobs)

287
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,213
Naoto, that's enough.

288
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,382
(Takemichi grunts in video)

289
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:31,096
We were after evidence proving
Kisaki's involvement in Hinata's murder.

290
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,766
These videos are proof.

291
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,893
I told you, that's enough!

292
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,024
Chifuyu Matsuno had been
hiding these videos from me.

293
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,318
(gasping)

294
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,906
He was protecting you.

295
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,200
(breathes heavily)

296
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,120
(ominous music)

297
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,915
(gasping)

298
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,750
(grunts)

299
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,295
(breathes heavily)

300
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,508
TAKEMICHI: This time, it's me.

301
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,220
I'm the one...

302
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,014
who killed...

303
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,558
Hina.

304
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,062
(exhale deeply)

305
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,271
NAOTO: Isn't that right?

306
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,983
Takemichi.

307
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,735
You were used. That's all.

308
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,487
TAKEMICHI: I've had it.

309
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,115
I can't do this.

310
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,078
How many times had this been?
But nothing has changed.

311
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,664
In fact, it has gotten even worse.

312
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,165
I killed...

313
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,001
Hina.

314
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,505
And Akkun and Chifuyu
and all those guys died too!

315
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,049
(both grunt)

316
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,220
And there's nothing
I can do for Baji either!

317
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,889
I can only go back to today 12 years ago!

318
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,058
There's no way I can save him!

319
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,269
Screaming and crying won't help!

320
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,771
(breathes heavily)

321
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,232
This is just as rough on me.

322
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,567
No, it's not!

323
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,445
I murdered your sister!

324
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,031
Let's just give up, Naoto!

325
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,492
I can't change anything!

326
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,748
You saved me!

327
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,001
NAOTO: What you've done has helped!

328
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,422
In the first timeline,

329
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,217
neither Toman nor Ken Ryuguji existed.

330
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,846
There was no Chifuyu Matsuno,
no Kazutora Hanemiya,

331
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,556
and no Keisuke Baji either.

332
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,184
None of them still existed, Takemichi.

333
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,438
NAOTO: <i>Without their influence,</i>

334
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,399
<i>we would never have
gotten this far into Toman.</i>

335
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,486
The one who kept their influence alive

336
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,904
was you!

337
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,072
(sobs)

338
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,616
You're the only one

339
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,535
who can change Toman
and who can save Hinata!

340
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,914
Please, transform this hellish world,

341
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,207
Takemichi!

342
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,297
Naoto,

343
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,050
the last time I traveled back in time,

344
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,261
I became the captain of
Toman's First Division.

345
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,349
I was a step closer to
becoming the leader of Toman.

346
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,811
So, I thought things would
be better in the present.

347
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,939
But Hina was still killed.

348
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,359
And what's worse,
it was me who killed her.

349
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,403
This is just conjecture,

350
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:37,950
but do you think Kisaki
had you kill my sister on purpose?

351
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,034
What?

352
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,328
NAOTO: Don't you think it's odd?

353
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,915
No matter how many times you go back,

354
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,252
Kisaki always ends up
having my sister killed.

355
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,295
(gasps)

356
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,713
Could it be a coincidence?

357
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,173
No.

358
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,717
It has happened too often
to be a coincidence.

359
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,969
It never fails.

360
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,846
You mean...

361
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,557
Tetta Kisaki clearly...

362
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,893
has some obsession with you and my sister.

363
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,936
TAKEMICHI: <i>What?</i>

364
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,899
...my hero.

365
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,734
(gasps)

366
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,320
-(knocks on door)
-(grunts)

367
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,740
I want us to plan things out,
but there's no time.

368
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,410
You'll be sent
to the detection center now.

369
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,370
The detention center?

370
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,874
It'll be difficult for us
to meet like this anymore.

371
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,629
Now is your only chance to go back.

372
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,298
(knocking continues)

373
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,341
What? But...

374
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,678
(sighs)

375
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,514
All right.

376
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,895
Whatever happened between you
and Tetta Kisaki in the past

377
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:51,732
must be the key to the mystery
behind my sister's death.

378
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,900
Right.

379
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,486
(dramatic music playing)

380
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,656
(electricity crackles)

381
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,575
(gasps)

382
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,245
TAKEMICHI: <i>Thank you, Chifuyu...</i>

383
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,456
<i>and Kazutora.</i>

384
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,791
<i>Thanks to you two,
I know who the enemy is.</i>

385
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,419
<i>The ex-BLACK DRAGON members</i>

386
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,463
<i>and Tetta Kisaki.</i>

387
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,632
<i>That's what corrupted Mikey.</i>

388
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,718
<i>I'll drive them out of Toman</i>

389
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,346
<i>to save Hina</i>

390
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,264
<i>and save everyone!</i>

391
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,724
(thuds)

392
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,979
What?

393
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,398
Another strike!

394
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,276
What? Bowling?

395
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,488
You're amazing, Takemichi!

396
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,658
That's a turkey!

397
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,951
Yeah...

398
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,288
(light music)

399
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,249
I'm just awful at this.

400
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,963
TAKEMICHI: <i>After seeing just how
horrible the present is,</i>

401
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,048
<i>Hina's smile makes me want to...</i>

402
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,841
What's wrong?

403
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,970
Nothing at all.

404
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,389
HINA: Go!

405
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,848
TAKEMICHI: She's so cute!

406
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,813
Darn it! Another gutter ball!

407
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:17,442
TAKEMICHI: <i>Come to think of it.
I was really into bowling at this time.</i>

408
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,531
<i>I had my own bowling glove
and shoes, and even my own ball.</i>

409
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,366
<i>I was really serious about it.</i>

410
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,120
<i>Okay! I'm still just as sharp as then!</i>

411
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,372
It's your turn, Takemichi!

412
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,416
(grunts)

413
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,959
TAKEMICHI, HINATA
BOWLER:TAKEMICHI

414
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,044
Watch this, Hina.

415
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,508
This will be my fourth!

416
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,553
I'll get four strikes in a row!

417
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,310
What?

418
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,895
Oh, wow!

419
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,898
TAKEMICHI:
<i>The next lane gets a strike too?</i>

420
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,526
HAKKAI: We both got strikes.

421
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,611
(gasps)

422
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,697
(upbeat music)

423
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,575
We were perfectly in sync.

424
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,619
(gasps)

425
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,457
(closing theme music playing)
