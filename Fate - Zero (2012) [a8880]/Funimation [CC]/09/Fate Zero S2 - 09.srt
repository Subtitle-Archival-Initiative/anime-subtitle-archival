1
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:19,544
Finally made it.

2
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:21,489
Hey, Waver!

3
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:25,062
No, no, not there. Over here.

4
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:28,279
Grandpa, what are you doing up there?

5
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:31,727
Enough with the questions, just come on up here.

6
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:33,558
Let's talk for a while.

7
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:35,403
He wants to talk?

8
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:37,359
Why do we have to talk on the roof?

9
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:40,604
Grandpa, can't it wait a while?

10
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:43,106
Oh, come on, don't be like that.

11
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:46,494
He really does like you, boy.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,984
Rider, come on, they're just under my spell and...

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,527
Oh, go up there.

14
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,779
The old man seems to have something
important he wants to tell you.

15
00:00:57,782 --> 00:01:01,412
Relax, boy, I'll patrol the area and keep watch.

16
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:03,132
Don't be shy.

17
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:05,218
That's not the problem.

18
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,452
I love it up here.

19
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:48,515
This is the best place to catch
the first rays of the morning sun.

20
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,889
Take a seat.

21
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:57,005
Here, I even have some coffee for you,

22
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:58,417
it'll warm you up.

23
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:01,542
Grandpa, just how long have you been sitting up here?

24
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:06,353
When I woke up this morning and checked in
on you, I saw you hadn't made it back yet,

25
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:12,186
so I thought I'd take the opportunity to watch the
sun come up while I waited for my grandson to come home.

26
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:21,116
When you were just a tyke, we used to come up to
the roof on clear nights and stargaze all the time.

27
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:23,264
Do you remember?

28
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:26,288
Yeah, I guess.

29
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:33,020
When Martha and I decided to live in Japan, we made
sure to build our house up here in the hills of Miyama

30
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:37,262
and built it with a large skylight, so
we could easily gain access to the roof.

31
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:43,425
We dreamed of sitting up here gazing at the
beautiful sky with our grandchildren alongside us,

32
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:46,287
entranced by the stars as much as we were.

33
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:50,057
We never thought our wish
would actually come true, though.

34
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:58,145
In all these years, our real grandchildren
never once came up here to watch the sky with us.

35
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:03,321
Sadly, whenever I've come up here to
stargaze, I've always been alone until now.

36
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,781
Now, Waver, you really aren't our grandson, are you?

37
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:18,252
It's very strange, the way Martha

38
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:22,589
and I were so completely convinced
that you were actually part of our family.

39
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:26,729
To be honest, you were a bit too nice to be our grandson.

40
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:28,459
You really messed up there.

41
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:34,310
I suppose you're pretty mad.

42
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:38,933
Well, I guess I probably have every right to be, Waver.

43
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:44,642
But lately, Martha's been acting so happy
and smiling nearly every moment of every day.

44
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,613
I couldn't have imagined her like that before.

45
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,528
Really, I'm very grateful to the both of you.

46
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:52,771
It's been quite a blessing.

47
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:56,082
Besides, it doesn't seem to me you decided to move in

48
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:59,065
with Martha and I because you
intended to cause us any harm.

49
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,762
So, what do you think?

50
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:09,044
If you can, Martha and I would really
like it if you'd stay with us a while longer.

51
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:15,867
I'm sorry, I can't promise that.

52
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,070
I can't even guarantee I'll make it back here safely.

53
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:23,091
So, I gather you two are risking your lives?

54
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,944
Yes.

55
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:30,264
Well, I can't even begin to venture a guess as to
how important whatever it is you're doing is to you,

56
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:34,009
but when you've had a long life
like me and look back on it all,

57
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:39,599
you come to realize that there is absolutely
nothing in this world so valuable or so important

58
00:05:39,652 --> 00:05:42,785
that it's really worth risking that life for.

59
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:05,552
I guess it's been about 40 hours
since I last slept... maybe more.

60
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:08,688
To win the battle and summon the grail,

61
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:14,226
one must perform the ritual at the
location of one of the four Fuyuki ley lines.

62
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:18,767
At two of them, the church and the Tohsaka Estate,

63
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,570
Kirei Kotomine was nowhere to be found,

64
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:23,623
which leaves the other two:

65
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:27,457
Here at Mt. Enzo and the Fuyuki Citizens Building.

66
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:29,649
Given the ley lines' relative power,

67
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:31,173
this one is more likely.

68
00:06:31,613 --> 00:06:33,645
Even if he's chosen the Citizens Building,

69
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,834
I can launch a frontal assault there.

70
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:42,157
If Maiya were still alive, I
would have sent her to secure it.

71
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,214
Once again, I'm all alone.

72
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,360
Come to think of it, I never
really figured her into my plans.

73
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,460
Since last night,

74
00:07:06,712 --> 00:07:12,353
I've been searching the whole city for
Irisviel's location, but I found no sign of her.

75
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,327
I am deeply sorry.

76
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,355
Well, then, if you need me,

77
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,477
summon me using the command seal.

78
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,394
Wake up.

79
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:44,854
Can you hear me, woman?

80
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:51,818
So, it's you, Kirei.

81
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,817
This building was once the place
where Caster's young master hid,

82
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:01,910
though it appears that Kiritsugu
Emiya was never able to locate it.

83
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:05,265
Soon, the Holy Grail War will be over.

84
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:11,097
It's likely that I'll be the one that will
have the power to grant the wish of the Einzberns.

85
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,798
Are you so unhappy that it would be me?

86
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:18,075
There is but one man to whom I would entrust the grail,

87
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:21,757
and it is certainly not you, Inquisitor.

88
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:27,443
Kiritsugu Emiya has already seen right through you, Kirei.

89
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:31,298
He recognizes you as his most dangerous enemy.

90
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:32,883
You can't escape.

91
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:35,775
Your words are as the gospel to my ears.

92
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:41,387
Kiritsugu Emiya is exactly as
I imagined him to be after all.

93
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:43,621
How laughable.

94
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:47,274
You couldn't be any further from him if you tried.

95
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:49,532
What did you say?

96
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:52,451
Even though Kiritsugu can see through you,

97
00:08:52,638 --> 00:08:54,391
the reverse is impossible.

98
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:57,853
You have none of the wonderful things

99
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,865
that he carries deep inside his heart.

100
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,580
Why do you speak of me in such a manner, woman?

101
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:10,168
I freely admit it, I'm a man
who is empty and desolate inside.

102
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:12,910
So, how do he and I differ?

103
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,589
Devoted himself to one fruitless
war after another for years?

104
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:19,963
Senseless slaughter, utter recklessness, wasted effort?!

105
00:09:20,262 --> 00:09:25,221
If he does not doubt or find this
life pointless as I do, then what is he?

106
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:33,215
Tell me, what is his wish?

107
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,529
What would he ask of the Holy Grail?

108
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:39,674
What prayer would he entrust to the wish‐granting device?

109
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:47,771
Very well, I'll tell you.

110
00:09:48,785 --> 00:09:50,931
Kiritsugu Emiya's wish

111
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:54,273
is humanity's salvation,

112
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,487
an end to all warfare

113
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,396
and bloodshed and suffering...

114
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:00,507
forever.

115
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:03,397
True peace upon the Earth.

116
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:10,378
What was that?

117
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:13,445
You can never understand it.

118
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:16,541
That is the difference between you two;

119
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,154
he has something to believe in.

120
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:24,830
Conflict is intrinsic to humanity.

121
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:28,502
To eliminate it completely would mean

122
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:31,117
the elimination of humanity itself.

123
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:34,081
As an ideal, it's totally futile,

124
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:37,087
nonsense that a child would spout.

125
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:42,403
Yes, and that is why his only hope is for a true miracle.

126
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,759
Many times, Kiritsugu has been forced to...

127
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:51,933
to sacrifice the lives of people
he's loved because of his beliefs.

128
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:57,645
Yes, you see, he's far too kind to chase ideals.

129
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,310
He must love even knowing

130
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:04,014
it will mean losing that love.

131
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,322
I understand.

132
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:40,268
I understand well.

133
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:42,649
So, that is Kiritsugu Emiya.

134
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:51,942
At last, I see it, my reason for fighting.

135
00:11:55,037 --> 00:12:00,184
Kiritsugu Emiya, I shall grind
your ideals to dust right before you,

136
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:03,164
along with the Holy Grail you long for.

137
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,942
Oh, you finally woke up, boy.

138
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,092
I thought I told you to wake me up at nightfall.

139
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:35,218
Did you forget?

140
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:40,343
Oh, sorry, but I thought it might be
good to take our time with preparations.

141
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:43,363
Tonight, there is no reason to rush.

142
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:44,902
How come?

143
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,143
I can't say why exactly.

144
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:52,349
It feels like everything will be concluding tonight.

145
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:53,822
Uh‐huh.

146
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:57,237
The night air seems way too still.

147
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:01,768
Is that because there are fewer
participants still in the fight?

148
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:10,646
From now on, only the truly strong remain in the battle.

149
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:17,260
W‐what was that?

150
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:20,127
It's a very strange mana surge.

151
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:22,893
I felt something similar before.

152
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:29,231
Look at that pattern.

153
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:32,286
What is it... some kind of secret code, do you think?

154
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:34,627
Four and seven in different colors.

155
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,609
"Success and victory."

156
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:38,715
If they're sending up that signal...

157
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:42,927
...does that mean that someone
got the grail and the war is over?

158
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:44,418
No, it's coming up from

159
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:47,733
a completely different direction than the church is,

160
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:50,668
which means that the church didn't send the message.

161
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,249
In essence, somebody is getting way ahead
of themselves and claiming to be victorious.

162
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:00,481
That says, "If you object, come and get me!"

163
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,492
It is an obvious challenge.

164
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,482
It looks like the big showdown is going to happen tonight.

165
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:12,156
I see, that means this is it, then.

166
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:13,678
Quite right, boy!

167
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:17,564
Now that we have our battlefield,

168
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:24,549
I must go forth and bring honor to the rider
class and ride gloriously into the final fray!

169
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:28,007
Come now, my steed!

170
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:39,976
Now then, boy, it may not be as
smooth a ride as by chariot, but... Huh?

171
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,608
Hey, what are you waiting for?

172
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:43,621
Come on!

173
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:49,142
From this point, only the
truly strong can continue, right?

174
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:59,260
My servant, Rider, by his command
seal, Waver Velvet orders you...

175
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:03,518
fight until you attain the victory you seek.

176
00:15:06,191 --> 00:15:11,857
And by my command seal, I further order
that you, Rider, go now and win the Holy Grail.

177
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:17,862
And by command seal, I further order, Rider,

178
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,573
take the world for your own.

179
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:21,427
I will not tolerate failure.

180
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:27,170
There, it's all over.

181
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:29,323
I'm no longer your master.

182
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,801
Go, go wherever you wish.

183
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,634
I don't even wanna see you.

184
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:43,021
I'll certainly be on my way in a moment,

185
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:46,282
but after all those annoying orders you just gave,

186
00:15:46,622 --> 00:15:49,322
surely you're prepared to see this though to the end?

187
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,722
You total idiot, listen to me!

188
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,600
I used the command seals and quit being your master!

189
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:56,653
Why would you still wanna take me, dammit?!

190
00:15:58,077 --> 00:15:59,023
I'm not your...

191
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:02,091
Master or not, boy, you are still my friend

192
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:03,406
and always will be.

193
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:04,320
Huh?

194
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:11,401
I'm... you mean...

195
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,767
you're really okay with me?

196
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:16,855
You want someone like me by your side?

197
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:18,050
What are you saying?

198
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:21,763
After all the battles you and I have
seen together, you have to ask that?

199
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,663
Idiot.

200
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:28,321
Up until now, have you not
faced the same enemies as I have?

201
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:29,831
That means you're my friend.

202
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,746
So, be proud and consider yourself

203
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:34,604
my equal.

204
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:45,366
All right, I shall begin by
obeying the first of your orders.

205
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:48,330
Now, boy, keep your eyes open to the end!

206
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,850
Well, let's see what she can do.

207
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,627
Right before my open eyes!

208
00:17:14,423 --> 00:17:20,343
He chose the place least suited to the required
ritual only to gain the early initiative in battle.

209
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:24,846
In other words, his plan is not to obtain the grail,

210
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:28,243
but rather to use it as bait

211
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:32,770
to lure me and the other masters
into a trap, then kill us all.

212
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:38,897
That simplifies things.

213
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,590
If he's going to be this incompetent,

214
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,987
I'll just outmaneuver and eliminate him quickly.

215
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,129
Kirei Kotomine.

216
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,272
Hm, very impressive.

217
00:17:56,352 --> 00:18:00,669
I must say, you look particularly
ferocious tonight, Kirei.

218
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:03,752
Now what will you do?

219
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,774
Do you wish for me to stay here and wait?

220
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:12,503
Unleashing all of your power at this close
range could endanger the ceremony itself.

221
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,851
If you want to fight it full strength
you'll have to go out and meet them.

222
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:21,210
Very well, what if this place
falls under attack while I'm gone?

223
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:25,626
Will you allow me to utilize
the command seals to save myself?

224
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,805
I will, but I do not guarantee the Holy Grail's safety.

225
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:32,686
For tonight, I shant be holding back.

226
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,827
That would be the worst outcome,

227
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:37,725
but if that should happen, it will be fate.

228
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:42,869
Kirei, you seem to have finally
found your reason to fight,

229
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:46,622
but have you still no prayer to offer the Holy Grail?

230
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,621
I can think of nothing I want.

231
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:56,601
My only hope is that nothing will interfere
with the conduct of the battle we're about to enter.

232
00:18:57,081 --> 00:19:04,089
Honestly, Kirei, as I suspected, the only recourse is
to let the grail reveal what hides within your heart.

233
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:13,134
Oh, if it appears as if Saber will
be arriving here before I can return,

234
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,334
just have Berserker entertain her for a little while.

235
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:18,358
Understood.

236
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:23,843
Speaking of Saber, what happened to
the doll that was so important to her?

237
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:28,845
The Holy Grail's vessel is inside of her, is it not?

238
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:31,724
I took her life.

239
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:34,994
I had no reason to let her continue living.

240
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,727
Are you crying?

241
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:05,157
Are you, Mother?

242
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:09,156
Hey, Mother, I had a scary dream.

243
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:12,055
I dreamed that I turned into a cup,

244
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:17,822
and then I dreamed that these seven
gigantic lumps started to come into my body.

245
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,008
It's okay, it's okay.

246
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:23,207
I would never let that happen.

247
00:20:23,403 --> 00:20:26,508
I promise that will never happen to you, Illya.

248
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,325
I know in my heart that you'll be
released from the shackles of fate.

249
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:51,467
Where am I?

250
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:54,951
Inside the Holy Grail?

251
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:56,649
This shouldn't be happening!

252
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:08,531
If I'm here...

253
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:11,984
who am I?

254
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:32,092
That's right, this is inside the Holy Grail:

255
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:36,896
The omnipotent wish‐granting device
that will dispel all the world's sadness

256
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:39,303
and remove all its suffering.

257
00:21:40,251 --> 00:21:42,685
I will have the power to make that happen.

258
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:47,907
The end is nearly at hand.

259
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:31,328
Our enemy is the mighty King of
Heroes, a most worthy opponent!

260
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:34,151
Our noble path of ultimate conquest!

261
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:37,873
King of Conquerors, know the end of your eternal dream.

262
00:23:37,913 --> 00:23:40,573
I shall show you the stark reality.
