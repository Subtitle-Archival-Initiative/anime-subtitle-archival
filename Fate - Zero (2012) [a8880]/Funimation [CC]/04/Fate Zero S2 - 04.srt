1
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,705
Murdered?

2
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:16,848
I can't... believe it.

3
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,441
Why would anyone kill him?

4
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:20,948
It's unthinkable!

5
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:23,539
This cannot be allowed!

6
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:31,642
It must also be regrettable for you

7
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:33,851
to lose your father in this way.

8
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:34,871
It is.

9
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,562
Father Risei was very dear.

10
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:40,195
He was just like a second father to me.

11
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:44,188
It's been one unexpected disaster after another.

12
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:49,129
I think it might prove necessary
to formulate a new plan right away.

13
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:01,108
Why did you not tell Tokiomi?

14
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:04,989
Tell him what?

15
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:07,017
I pity your father.

16
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:11,127
He died believing his son to be a pious man of God.

17
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,714
Or...

18
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:15,806
perhaps that was his salvation.

19
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,489
Does your father's death arouse no feeling in you?

20
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,821
He was killed, after all.

21
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:27,345
You could at least attempt to appear a little upset.

22
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:28,644
I am.

23
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,981
I'm furious to no end.

24
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,070
Furious, you say?

25
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:35,499
Are you...

26
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:38,757
furious because you were unable to kill him yourself?

27
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:49,174
Saber?

28
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,692
Irisviel, how are you feeling?

29
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:57,878
It appears I've made you worry about me again.

30
00:03:58,386 --> 00:03:59,320
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:00,481
No.

32
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:02,521
As long as you are truly fine.

33
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:04,911
That is all that really matters to me.

34
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:06,540
But then...

35
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:12,382
It's okay.

36
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:14,795
It's Maiya's presence you are sensing.

37
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:16,757
Tohsaka?

38
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:17,978
Yes.

39
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,738
He requests that we present a united front.

40
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,524
Wait, an alliance?

41
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:23,731
At this stage?

42
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:26,463
The thought of dealing with Rider and Berserker

43
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:29,135
must have Tohsaka feeling father uneasy.

44
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:33,112
And so, assuming that we would be the most amenable,

45
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:34,729
he has invited us to meet.

46
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:38,948
Meaning that he considers us
the weakest of the remaining teams.

47
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:43,687
Tohsaka said that he wishes to meet
with you tonight over at the Fuyuki church.

48
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:48,739
You should know that from the very start
Tokiomi Tohsaka has made elaborate preparations

49
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:51,392
to try and ensure his victory in this Grail War.

50
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,627
And it's also likely

51
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,249
that in total secret

52
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:58,752
he controlled Assassin's master, Kirei Kotomine.

53
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,623
If that's true, and Tohsaka
exerts some influence over Kotomine,

54
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:09,642
then I believe it would be a mistake
if we choose to ignore this offer.

55
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:11,558
Yes, you're right.

56
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:14,823
Kirei Kotomine?

57
00:05:15,838 --> 00:05:17,604
Remember this, Saber,

58
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:23,994
if there is anyone in this war who can defeat
Kiritsugu and claim the Holy Grail for himself,

59
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,812
it is the man named Kirei Kotomine.

60
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:32,689
Go and tell them.

61
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:34,208
We accept.

62
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:45,749
Father?

63
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:51,995
Hi, Father!

64
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,734
Rin, your father says that he
would like to speak with you.

65
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:29,814
Rin...

66
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:33,581
keep the Mage's Association in your debt till you grow up.

67
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:37,252
After that, I leave the rest to your judgment.

68
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:40,795
I'm certain you'll be fine on your own.

69
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:43,812
The Holy Grail will appear one day,

70
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:46,980
it is the Tohsaka family's duty to claim it.

71
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:50,479
Above all, if you wish to be a mage, Rin,

72
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:52,532
it's a path you cannot avoid.

73
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:55,873
Here, take this.

74
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,259
Oh!

75
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:03,588
I have to go now.

76
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:06,259
You know what to do, right?

77
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:08,032
Yes.

78
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:12,516
I'll see you soon.

79
00:07:12,596 --> 00:07:13,663
Take care, Father.

80
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,163
First, allow me to thank you for coming here at my behest.

81
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,399
I very much appreciate it.

82
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,117
Let me introduce Kirei Kotomine,

83
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:44,170
my long‐time apprentice.

84
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,277
While we were once honorable competitors
in this battle for the Holy Grail,

85
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,830
all that is now in the past.

86
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,675
He has lost his servant, and as a
result, has yielded his rights as a master.

87
00:07:57,688 --> 00:08:00,749
This Grail War is rapidly heading toward its conclusion.

88
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,801
The one's remaining are, as anticipated,

89
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:08,485
the masters of the three great
houses along with one outsider.

90
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,861
Now, what is your appraisal of the state of the war?

91
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:14,274
I have no opinion.

92
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,056
We control the most powerful servant, Saber,

93
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:19,468
and don't need to wait for the best time to strike.

94
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:21,979
We shall simply continue to win each battle.

95
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:23,203
Hm.

96
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,282
Unfortunately for the Matous,

97
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,450
it is my opinion that they erred in their strategy.

98
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:35,144
They have imposed a draining servant upon a frail
master, thereby hastening his self‐destruction.

99
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,667
Rider is likely to be the victor between them.

100
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:42,868
The Grail must not be allowed to fall into outside hands.

101
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:47,322
The two of us should be able to agree on that much.

102
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,197
Any alliance is out of the question.

103
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,956
However, if you wish to discuss the
order in which we approach our enemies,

104
00:08:54,102 --> 00:08:56,551
we may be able to come to some equitable agreement.

105
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,325
Go on.

106
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:02,391
We can settle things with the Tohsaka team

107
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,743
after defeating the other masters.

108
00:09:05,237 --> 00:09:07,554
We are prepared to agree to such a proposal.

109
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:10,990
So a temporary conditional ceasefire?

110
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,492
That is a fair compromise.

111
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:16,440
We have two conditions.

112
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,879
The first is that you agree to share with us
any and all information you may have gathered

113
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:24,185
concerning Rider and his master.

114
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:26,117
Agreed.

115
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:28,173
Our second condition is

116
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:32,231
that Kirei Kotomine be removed from the Holy Grail War.

117
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:36,982
Kirei?

118
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:39,902
I am not suggesting in any way he be killed,

119
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:42,769
but I insist that until this battle is over,

120
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:47,125
he be expelled from Fuyuki, or
better yet, from Japan entirely.

121
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:49,578
Immediately, before morning.

122
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,326
Would you explain why?

123
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,574
Because of the bad blood

124
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:59,492
between the Einzberns and the so‐called Inquisitor.

125
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:02,861
If the Tohsaka team continues to protect him,

126
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,578
we will find ourselves unable to
trust you under any circumstances.

127
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:09,698
What does she mean?

128
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,066
Kirei.

129
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:20,257
Well, Saber,how do you like Kiritsugu's present?

130
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,597
Very much so.

131
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,947
It is more like a horse than a car is.

132
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:25,893
It seems to suit me much better.

133
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:27,913
I shall go ahead then

134
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:30,512
and scout out the route ahead for us.

135
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:37,947
We should go now as well.

136
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,660
Ma... madam, what's the matter?

137
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:47,936
Please drive, Maiya.

138
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:49,188
You sure?

139
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:52,530
Tohsaka will suspect something's wrong.

140
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:03,118
What's happening to me really isn't unexpected.

141
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:05,493
It was actually inevitable.

142
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:13,925
Honestly, the fact that I've been able to function
as a human for this long... is really quite a miracle.

143
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:17,674
Does Kiritsugu know about this?

144
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:19,946
Yes, but don't tell Saber.

145
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:23,165
She has a crucial battle to fight ahead of her.

146
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:26,315
I don't want to distract her with all of this.

147
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:30,259
But listen, Maiya, there's something I need to tell you.

148
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:35,561
I am a homunculus created
specifically for the Holy Grail War.

149
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:37,954
You know about that, right?

150
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:39,127
Yes.

151
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:44,516
Grandfather Acht ingrained in the
vessel an instinct for self‐preservation

152
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:49,537
so that it would avoid all danger and
safeguard the Grail to its completion.

153
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:54,636
He disguised the vessel so he could hide
it in plain sight and called it Irisviel.

154
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:57,071
That is who I am.

155
00:11:58,101 --> 00:11:58,959
But how?

156
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,934
Then that means that you are...

157
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,174
Very soon now.

158
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:05,044
I will revert back to what I originally was.

159
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:11,547
When that happens, I won't even be able to
talk to you or anyone else like this anymore.

160
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:16,186
That's the reason why Kiritsugu
gave me Saber's scabbard to keep.

161
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:20,935
Avalon, are you familiar with its effects?

162
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:24,455
It halts aging and provides an infinite healing ability.

163
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:26,230
Or so I'm told.

164
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:30,000
Its effects are what have
prevented the hollow shell that is me

165
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:32,080
from collapsing in on itself.

166
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:36,262
Of course, they stop working as soon as Saber is away.

167
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,685
And I start to deteriorate.

168
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:41,835
Madam, why are you telling me all this?

169
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:47,897
Because, Maiya Hisau, under no
circumstances would you ever pity me.

170
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:50,979
You would accept me for what I am.

171
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:53,005
That's why I tell you.

172
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:56,860
Madam, Irisviel, I'm afraid I've always

173
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,124
thought that you were beyond my reach.

174
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:00,963
No, I'm not really.

175
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,040
Do you understand?

176
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:04,067
Yes.

177
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:08,079
Even if it costs me my life, Irisviel,

178
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:11,273
I will see you through to the very end.

179
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:13,134
And so please...

180
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:17,016
please die now for Kiritsugu Emiya

181
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,928
to make his dream a reality.

182
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:25,791
Thank you.

183
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:33,120
I really wish you had told me of your
troubled history with the Einzberns.

184
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,860
Unfortunately, I have no choice.

185
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,445
You must withdraw from the Holy Grail War

186
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:43,066
immediately.

187
00:13:57,364 --> 00:14:01,607
Kiritsugu Emiya, who are you really?

188
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,724
Will I leave this place

189
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:07,634
never even learning that?

190
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,489
Still thinking about what to do even now?

191
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:16,005
Could you truly be so slow, Kirei?

192
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:20,208
The Holy Grail beckons to you still.

193
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:26,274
And even you yourself still long
to jump into the fight and claim it.

194
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:29,407
For as long as I remember,

195
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:32,738
I've spent my life in search of a single thing.

196
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:35,260
I've devoted every moment

197
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:37,194
and endured great pain for it,

198
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:39,676
but all of that has come to naught.

199
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,903
Yet I sense that the answer to my question

200
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,054
is closer to me now than it has ever been before.

201
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,469
After all of that self‐reflection,

202
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,817
why in the world do you still hesitate?

203
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,552
Because I fear

204
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:56,453
that when I've learned all the answers,

205
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:59,455
it will result in my utter destruction.

206
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:07,562
Understood, well done.

207
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:12,971
Ah, you've just received an
exciting bit of news, I take it.

208
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,260
We've finally learned the exact location of the
stronghold where the Einzberns have been hiding.

209
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:21,360
As I live and breathe!

210
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:23,312
You honestly amaze me.

211
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,007
You were planning to continue all along, weren't you?

212
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:28,875
I did hesitate.

213
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:31,130
I was even prepared to give up.

214
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,131
But in the end, it is just as you say, Archer...

215
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,879
I know no other way than to keep asking
the question until I find an answer.

216
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,080
What is that?

217
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,400
A gift from my father.

218
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:52,820
JN424.

219
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,466
The gospel of John.

220
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,465
"God is spirit, and those who worship Him

221
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:04,904
must worship in spirit and in truth."

222
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:11,153
However, Kirei,

223
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:14,737
there remains for you a rather grave problem.

224
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:22,368
Were you to participate in the Holy Grail War on
your own behalf, Tokiomi Tohsaka becomes your enemy.

225
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:26,652
In other words, you are in the
same room as an enemy's servant

226
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:30,110
with no real plan to actually defend yourself from him.

227
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,995
A dire situation, would you not agree?

228
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:34,628
No, not at all.

229
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,781
I came with something to trade for my life.

230
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:38,925
Really?

231
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:40,451
Gilgamesh.

232
00:16:41,111 --> 00:16:45,943
Let me reveal to you the truth behind the
Holy Grail War that has been kept from you.

233
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:47,220
And that is?

234
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:49,962
The magical ritual held here in Fuyuki

235
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:54,432
is an attempt by the winning mage to
open up a passage directly to the root

236
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:58,146
by the sacrifice of the souls of seven heroic spirits.

237
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:04,367
The activation of the Holy Grail can only be
achieved by the killing of all seven servants.

238
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,710
That's correct, all seven.

239
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:08,910
You understand?

240
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:13,608
That's the reason my master has worked
so hard to avoid using his command seals,

241
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:20,526
because when all the battles are finally over, he will
require them to force his own servant to commit suicide.

242
00:17:21,547 --> 00:17:23,999
So then the loyalty Tokiomi has shown me

243
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:26,958
has all been nothing but a lie from the very beginning?

244
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:28,751
To put it yet another way,

245
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:32,639
my master is first and foremost
a mage down to his very core.

246
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:35,891
He may worship a heroic spirit,

247
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:38,987
but he harbors no illusions about his idols.

248
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:44,872
Well, Tokiomi, at last you
have shown some hint of promise.

249
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:50,062
That dull excuse for a man will finally be
able to provide me with a measure of entertainment.

250
00:17:50,354 --> 00:17:53,057
Now then, what will you do, Gilgamesh?

251
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:56,823
Will you now choose to remain loyal to Tokiomi

252
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:59,586
and then punish me for rebelling against him?

253
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:01,974
Ah, a fair question, indeed.

254
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,143
Regardless of his treachery,

255
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,550
Tokiomi still supplies me with the mana I require.

256
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,808
Were I to abandon my master, it would
hamper my ability to remain materialized.

257
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:15,718
Oh, come to think of it,

258
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:18,064
there is a partnerless master I know of.

259
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:22,842
One who is actively searching for a
servant that is free and unbound by a contract.

260
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:23,780
Hmph.

261
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:25,979
Now that you mention it, you're right.

262
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:28,678
But of course, there is a question

263
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:33,157
of whether that man is a worthy
master in the eyes of the King of Heroes?

264
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:35,043
He will suffice.

265
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:38,347
He is a bit stiff and humorless, perhaps,

266
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,586
but he has great potential for growth.

267
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:45,180
He may yet prove himself a fine
source of entertainment for me.

268
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:47,129
Hm.

269
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:52,258
I've been waiting for you, Kirei.

270
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:56,159
I came to say goodbye and thank
you before I departed Fuyuki.

271
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,838
First, I'd like to say that I'm still very proud

272
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,885
to have had you as my student.

273
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:08,510
I hope you will maintain good
relations with the Tohsaka family,

274
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:11,598
as throughout the years your late father always did.

275
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:13,371
All right?

276
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:16,090
Your words honor me.

277
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,323
Once this Grail War has finally come to an end,

278
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:24,063
Kirei, I'd like for you to help train
my young daughter, Rin, to be a mage.

279
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:30,352
It's rather simple, but in
essence, this is a will I've prepared.

280
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,038
I thought it prudent to be ready in the
event the worst happened and I did not survive.

281
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:39,559
It leaves the entire wealth of the Tohsaka family to Rin.

282
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:42,367
And names you as her legal guardian

283
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,469
until she comes of age.

284
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:47,425
Leave it to me.

285
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:49,308
I shall do all I can

286
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:52,555
to look after your daughter
and keep her safe from any harm.

287
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,350
Thank you.

288
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:56,130
Kirei.

289
00:19:56,735 --> 00:19:57,667
What is this?

290
00:19:58,275 --> 00:19:59,777
A little something for you.

291
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:01,619
A gift from me.

292
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:03,003
Open it.

293
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:08,657
An Azoth dagger.

294
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:11,954
It symbolizes your mastery of magic,

295
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,067
and marks the completion of your apprenticeship to me.

296
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:17,381
I am without words.

297
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:19,234
You are far too kind to me.

298
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:21,549
I am filled with gratitude,

299
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:23,226
my master.

300
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,448
It is I who thanks you,

301
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:26,938
Kirei Kotomine.

302
00:20:27,738 --> 00:20:31,497
Now I can finish preparing for
the final battle of this war.

303
00:20:33,788 --> 00:20:35,511
Oh my, look at the time.

304
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,305
I'm sorry to have kept you here for so long.

305
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,514
I hope I haven't made you miss your flight.

306
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:52,539
No.

307
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:57,991
You needn't worry about it, my master.

308
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:09,879
You see, I never got around to buying myself a ticket.

309
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:26,473
Master.

310
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:29,401
How like my father you were.

311
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:35,022
Even at the very end, you never really
understood me or my inner motivations, did you?

312
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:41,327
Hah.

313
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:43,220
Such a boring end.

314
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:44,869
Look at that.

315
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:47,037
Such an idiotic expression.

316
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:51,451
He did have a dematerialized
servant at hand that he depended on.

317
00:21:52,082 --> 00:21:54,510
It was natural for him to lower his guard.

318
00:21:54,698 --> 00:21:57,149
So, you have learned to adjust already, have you?

319
00:21:57,894 --> 00:22:00,335
I praise you for your studious aptitude.

320
00:22:01,424 --> 00:22:02,448
Well, Kirei?

321
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:06,562
Do you feel a little better about not
having had the chance to kill your father?

322
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,241
So you have no qualms about this,

323
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:12,813
Gilgamesh, King of Heroes?

324
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:16,575
No, not so long as you continue to amuse me.

325
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:18,836
Otherwise, Kirei...

326
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,706
Well, you are the one who ought
to question your own resolve.

327
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:28,251
My will creates your body,

328
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,557
and your sword creates my destiny.

329
00:22:30,988 --> 00:22:32,828
If you heed the Grail's call

330
00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:35,769
and also obey my will and my reason.

331
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:39,914
Yes, I swear your offering will be my flesh,

332
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:43,405
Kirei Kotomine, my new master.

333
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:48,129
Now, Kirei,

334
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:49,791
let us begin.

335
00:22:50,878 --> 00:22:52,735
Put an end to this farce,

336
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,263
and as a reward for your loyalty,

337
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:57,767
I shall give you the Holy Grail.

338
00:22:58,225 --> 00:23:00,968
Very well then, King of Heroes.

339
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,725
May you have your fill of amusement from me.

340
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,742
Until such time I find the answer I seek,

341
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:10,083
I shall gladly play the fool for you.

342
00:24:44,412 --> 00:24:47,215
Tell me, Kari, what do you wanna grow up to be?

343
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:49,496
You must stop going up to that mansion.

344
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:51,096
What is all this? What is all this?

345
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:52,909
You can decide the rest for yourself.

346
00:24:52,947 --> 00:24:54,735
It's still too early for you.

347
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,322
It's a world‐changing power, and one day it will be yours.
