1
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:08,992
If there really is a giant monster out there,
do you think they'll authorize us to attack?

2
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:13,448
If this was a monster movie, I guarantee
we'd be the first to get killed off.

3
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:17,666
You know, curtain raisers to set things
up till the main character shows up.

4
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:19,946
Uh, that's not even funny, sir.

5
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:22,141
Whatever it is, we'll find out soon enough.

6
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:02,251
Didn't work, it's just restoring itself.

7
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:05,656
What incredible regenerating power.

8
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:08,440
It's all they can do to keep it from coming ashore.

9
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:11,073
Well, at this rate,

10
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:13,756
I'll never get through to Caster.

11
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:17,731
Awesome, so awesome.

12
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,324
That is so totally awesome, big guy!

13
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:24,411
The Lord has come.

14
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:28,133
The Lord has come!

15
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,940
It's terrible, how could this have happened?

16
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,775
In the long and winding history of the Holy Grail Wars,

17
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:08,648
a foul up like this is unprecedented.

18
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:11,456
According to our observers' reports,

19
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,927
even though the Mion River area is blanketed in mist,

20
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,700
a large number of onlookers
have already begun to gather there.

21
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:23,132
I fear we can no longer handle this by ourselves.

22
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:27,057
We must petition the Mage's Association for assistance.

23
00:03:31,635 --> 00:03:33,897
What is Tokiomi doing right now?

24
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:36,743
My master left for the scene with Archer

25
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,520
immediately after Caster's monster appeared.

26
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:44,479
In that case, I will see to
the arrangements for the cover up.

27
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,301
Go to Tokiomi immediately and
assist him in any way you can.

28
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:52,222
I understand, Father.

29
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:03,677
This sight has begun to turn my stomach.

30
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:10,173
Mongrels though they may be, they are
still figures of at least some slight renown.

31
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:16,158
Yet here they are working together with all
their might to finish off that disgusting thing.

32
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,621
Surely there are limits to which one may sink.

33
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:24,598
Do you not agree with that, Tokiomi?

34
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:28,489
We must destroy that monster

35
00:04:28,696 --> 00:04:31,240
before there are any more witnesses to the battle.

36
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:35,056
The honor of the Tohsaka family is at stake.

37
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:40,562
My king, that monster is a
vermin that is ravaging your garden.

38
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,269
I humbly beseech you to slay it yourself.

39
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:48,092
Dealing with pests is the job of a gardener,

40
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:51,679
or is your intent to mock my Noble Phantasms,

41
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,304
putting them on the level of a gardener's hoe, Tokiomi.

42
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,016
I would never dream of such a thing,

43
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:02,461
but as you can see, Majesty, this
creature is beyond the ability of the others.

44
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:06,091
It's the perfect opportunity
to demonstrate your true might.

45
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:08,656
I beg you, please take action.

46
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:14,301
Hm.

47
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:48,627
It can't be.

48
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:51,654
We're leaving, Tokiomi.

49
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:55,289
I've grown weary of watching that disgusting creature.

50
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:58,605
No, King of Heroes, wait, I beg you.

51
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,910
Tokiomi, I sacrificed four swords
thinking it might duty towards you.

52
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:11,441
Having been defiled by touching that filthy
thing, I have no interest in retrieving them.

53
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:14,560
Do not presume upon my generosity.

54
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,010
You are the only heroic spirit alive

55
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,843
able to defeat that thing.

56
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:24,864
Given its regenerative abilities, the sole way
to defeat it is to annihilate it in one strike.

57
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:29,616
Only your Sword of Dissociation is
capable of accomplishing that so‐-

58
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:30,510
You fool!

59
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,565
You dare suggest that I draw forth Ea here!

60
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:38,445
Don't forget your place, I should have your head

61
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:40,697
for being so impertinent to your king!

62
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,910
I could use a Command Seal, but if I did, it
would shatter my relationship with the King of Heroes.

63
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:56,768
Father Risei and I had originally
arranged for this Caster hunting expedition

64
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,664
so that I could recover the Command Seal I lost.

65
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:03,861
How could my plan be backfiring so badly?

66
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:11,887
Damn.

67
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:17,426
What the hell is that?

68
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:20,833
There's a weird light hovering in the sky at six o'clock.

69
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,291
It's not a helicopter.

70
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,763
Is it a UFO or something?

71
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:29,023
Control to Diablo One,

72
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:30,880
we need a situation report.

73
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:33,675
The situation is,

74
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,509
uh, well...

75
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:40,133
Diablo Two, gonna go down to get a closer look.

76
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,536
Wait, Kobayashi!

77
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,984
Diablo Two, get back here!

78
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:51,929
Official inspection from up close
will tell us what that thing is.

79
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:54,810
Kobayashi.

80
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,869
Kobayashi!

81
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,210
A fearsome creature indeed.

82
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:24,070
It... it ate it.

83
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,179
Control to Diablo One.

84
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,085
What's going on over there?

85
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:36,525
Report!

86
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:40,117
Eyes, it has eyes.

87
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:42,934
It's absolutely covered with eyes!

88
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:46,213
Eyes, what do you mean it has eyes?

89
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,812
Shit, that thing wants to eat me too.

90
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:52,278
Captain Ogi.

91
00:08:53,655 --> 00:08:55,506
Diablo One engaging.

92
00:08:56,112 --> 00:08:58,307
Wait, Ogi, engaging what?

93
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,631
I'll kill it before it gets me.

94
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,473
This is for Kobayashi.

95
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,547
I'm gonna pump you with missiles, ya bastard.

96
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:13,883
Berserker?

97
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,926
Oh man, what's he doing here?

98
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,979
You fool, stay down!

99
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,576
Now he decides to join us?

100
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,204
Isn't that...

101
00:09:33,444 --> 00:09:36,549
Ah, so that mad dog has turned up again.

102
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,397
This should be amusing.

103
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:44,556
My king, allow me to deal with his master.

104
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,112
Very well, merely toy with him.

105
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,796
Then good luck to us both, Your Majesty.

106
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:10,602
Dogs like you belong prostrated on the ground.

107
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,572
Yet you dare to climb into my sky.

108
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:18,487
Don't put on airs, you mongrel!

109
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,692
Such impertinence.

110
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:06,938
How amusing.

111
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:10,351
I've not played a game like this in quite some time.

112
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,139
For a lowly animal, you're providing me

113
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,814
with no shortage of entertainment.

114
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,747
I hardly recognize you,

115
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:27,610
Kariya Matou.

116
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,920
Though you turned your back on
magecraft, you still desired the Grail.

117
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,948
To think you'd slink back in such a sorry state.

118
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:41,178
The very sight of you is enough to invite whispers

119
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:44,368
that the Matou family has fallen from grace.

120
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:50,726
Tokiomi Tohsaka, answer me a question.

121
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:54,451
Why did you hand your daughter Sakura over to Zouken?

122
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,209
What?

123
00:11:57,293 --> 00:12:00,300
You really think that's what you
should be worrying about at this moment?

124
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,846
Answer me, Tokiomi!

125
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:06,475
Do you even need to ask?

126
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:11,076
I did it because I wished to give
my beloved daughter a happy future.

127
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:13,216
You what?

128
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:18,132
All mages who have two children eventually suffer for it.

129
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:22,145
The family's secret arts can be passed to only one child.

130
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:28,053
They suffer over the issue that one of
them must be cast down into the common masses.

131
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:32,861
The simple fact is that my
wife is superior breeding stock.

132
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:39,188
Both Rin and Sakura were born with equally
rare natural gifts and magical abilities.

133
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:45,980
And so both my daughters were in need of the
protection and nurturing attention of a mage family.

134
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:52,045
For the future of one daughter I must waste
the vast potential lurking deep inside the other?

135
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,536
What father would wish such a
woeful tragedy upon his children?

136
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:01,781
Common masses.

137
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:06,047
The memory of his children and their mother on that day.

138
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,997
This heartless man is writing it
off as something for the common masses.

139
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:15,791
If I was to preserve the hopes I
had for both sisters' abilities,

140
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:18,359
my only option would be to send one away.

141
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:22,885
That is why the Matou family's offer was such a godsend.

142
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:27,005
If she were to be adopted by a mage family,

143
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:30,484
it would give her that much
greater chance of reaching the root.

144
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,632
A mage is someone who is born with great power,

145
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:39,095
and before he knows it, he will
attain even greater heights of power.

146
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:43,624
Even before a mage embraces his destiny,

147
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:46,595
his responsibility to do so is in his blood.

148
00:13:47,337 --> 00:13:50,636
That is what it means to be born the child of a mage.

149
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:55,505
If I fail, it falls to my daughter, Rin,

150
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:59,873
and even if Rin fails in her quest, then Sakura

151
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:03,406
may yet fulfill the dream of the Tohsaka family.

152
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:10,122
You bastard, you want them to fight each other?

153
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:11,937
Sister against sister?

154
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,307
Even if such a development were to come to pass,

155
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,637
it is still best for the future of my descendents.

156
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:19,474
What?

157
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:22,107
Glory will go to the victor,

158
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:25,433
and to the loser, honor to the family of her forbearers.

159
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,322
The best outcome I could possibly hope for.

160
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:31,677
You bastard, you're insane!

161
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:34,918
It is a waste of time to try to explain it to you.

162
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:38,421
You don't comprehend magecraft's grandeur,

163
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:41,249
and even turned your back and walked away from it.

164
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:42,767
A lowly traitor.

165
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,413
Screw you, bastard!

166
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:53,925
I'll make all you bastards pay.

167
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:57,413
You filthy rotten mages.

168
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,825
I'll kill you all.

169
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:02,451
Zouken and you.

170
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:05,012
Every last one of you.

171
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:07,239
I'll kill you all.

172
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,338
When you turned down the family leadership,

173
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:14,186
the Matou's magic secrets were passed on to Sakura.

174
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:18,211
In spite of the fact that I really should be thanking you

175
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:20,404
for my Sakura's future,

176
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:24,217
you are one man that I simply cannot abide.

177
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:29,608
The weakness revealed by shirking of your obligations,

178
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,480
the deficient character revealed
by your lack of indebtedness to it.

179
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:36,517
You, Kariya Matou, are a disgrace.

180
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,340
Having crossed paths with you again I
have no choice but to put you to death.

181
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:46,763
Don't talk so high and mighty, you inhuman bastard.

182
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:52,556
You're mistaken, shouldering one's
responsibilities is the first requisite of being human.

183
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,940
It is those who fail to do so...

184
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:01,949
...that are subhuman dogs.

185
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:03,523
Kariya.

186
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:07,043
Hear me now, bugs. Devour this bastard.

187
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:10,502
Eat him alive!

188
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:16,449
Oh yeah, go get 'em, Bluebeard!

189
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:18,949
Crush 'em down, tear 'em apart!

190
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:21,636
This place is God's toy box!

191
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,183
Saber!

192
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,865
I am much obliged, Saber.

193
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,814
I'll never be bored again as long as I live.

194
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:53,924
I won't have to go through all
the trouble of murdering people.

195
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,531
They'll die in droves without me lifting a finger.

196
00:17:57,514 --> 00:18:02,178
They'll be flattened, chopped to bits, smashed, eaten.

197
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,350
They'll die and die and die left and right.

198
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,884
I'll be able to see one kind of guts and
gore after another that I've never seen before.

199
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:16,863
All day, every day, all around
the world, everywhere I look!

200
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,400
It'll be nonstop, never‐end...

201
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:26,660
It stopped moving.

202
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:27,331
Hm?

203
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:33,772
What the... hey, what happened?

204
00:18:36,404 --> 00:18:37,201
Huh?

205
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:47,316
That's so pretty.

206
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,779
Now I get it.

207
00:18:53,254 --> 00:18:55,916
No wonder I never realized it before.

208
00:18:56,674 --> 00:19:00,870
Oh man, talk about not being able
to see the forest for the trees.

209
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,220
It was in me.

210
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:06,211
I was looking for my own guts.

211
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:09,525
I didn't have to go searching for it.

212
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:12,578
It was hiding right there all along.

213
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:15,710
Ryuunosuke!

214
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,464
I finally found you.

215
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,952
I've been looking for you my whole life.

216
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:27,346
What the hell, man?

217
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,476
If you were inside me all along,

218
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:32,251
I wish you would've

219
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:36,717
just told me so in the first place.

220
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,721
Ryuunosuke, my master.

221
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:03,093
How could you die and leave me here all alone?

222
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,992
But never you fear, dear Ryuunosuke,

223
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:12,755
for I, Gilles de Rais, will fulfill
the solemn promise I made to you.

224
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:21,872
Ryuunosuke, watch closely! Behold my offering to you!

225
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:25,682
I shall give you the greatest "cool!" ever!

226
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,492
I just put down the man I believe to be Caster's master.

227
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,953
It looks like I was right about him.

228
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:44,927
While all the other servants are being distracted
by the monster, shall I eliminate the next target?

229
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:48,673
Wait, Maiya, that's no ordinary monster.

230
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:51,876
It's a creature with limitless regenerative ability.

231
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:55,737
It's still possible that it could
reach the shore before it dissipates.

232
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,567
If it does and begins to feed, it's all over.

233
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:02,672
Caster will have a new source of
mana to maintain his physical form.

234
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:05,552
If that happens, the damage will spread even further,

235
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:09,067
and there's a risk that the Holy
Grail War itself will break down.

236
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:10,753
Exactly.

237
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,612
But how do we kill an indestructible monster?

238
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,137
The only way is to annihilate it in a single strike.

239
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:21,487
To do that, its entire body will have to be incinerated.

240
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:24,544
Leaving nothing, not even the smallest scrap of flesh.

241
00:21:25,848 --> 00:21:28,514
Anti‐Personnel Noble Phantasms won't suffice.

242
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:30,504
An Anti‐Fortress one is needed.

243
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:36,419
Saber possesses just such an Anti‐Fortress Noble Phantasm.

244
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:41,861
However, because of Lancer's curse,

245
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:43,222
she can't use it.

246
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:46,737
We'll just have to wait and see

247
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,506
exactly what they can really accomplish

248
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:52,442
with their so‐called chivalric spirit.

249
00:23:26,724 --> 00:23:29,511
Oh, this brilliant light!

250
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,884
You prolonged the inevitable.

251
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,476
The invincible king is about to
cry out the true name of the miracle.

252
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:36,226
It is too painful to look upon.

253
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,506
Is he trying to kill himself?

254
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:38,846
We must stop its advance!

255
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:40,973
I'm counting on you, Saber.
