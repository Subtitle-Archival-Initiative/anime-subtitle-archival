1
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,406
Rider, over there.

2
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,847
Are you scared, boy?

3
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:41,549
Yeah, I'm scared.

4
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:45,197
I'm wondering if this is what you mean

5
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:47,834
when you say that your heart is dancing.

6
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:52,768
Hm, it seems you're finally starting to understand.

7
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:03,020
The enemy is inside.

8
00:01:24,976 --> 00:01:26,035
Berserker?

9
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:05,386
Are they having a party here?

10
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:08,305
Where is that little chariot of yours?

11
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,589
Well, the thing is,

12
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:15,592
I'm embarrassed to say I lost it to Saber in a battle.

13
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:18,356
Did you forget my decision?

14
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:23,125
I believe I told you that I would fight
and defeat you when you were at full strength.

15
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,283
True, the weapons at my disposal are somewhat depleted.

16
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:33,776
However, Iskandar tonight is less than perfect,
and thus, is far greater than perfection itself.

17
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,364
So I see.

18
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,699
Indeed the aura that is emanating from you

19
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:41,736
is unusually potent.

20
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:48,678
It appears you have come before me actually
believing that you have a chance of victory.

21
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:50,291
Hm.

22
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:02,438
King of Babylonia, a final word.

23
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:04,900
Our banquet's last question.

24
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:07,743
I shall allow it, speak.

25
00:04:08,138 --> 00:04:10,692
Well, this is purely hypothetical of course,

26
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:14,039
but were my Ionioi Hetairoi
armed with your Gate of Babylon,

27
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,554
it would create the most powerful army imaginable.

28
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:19,438
Hm, so?

29
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:23,663
Why would you not ally yourself with me?

30
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,933
The two of us together could conquer
the universe and beyond if we desired it.

31
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:35,287
You never cease to amuse me, mongrel.

32
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:40,931
It has been ages since I laughed so hard at
gibberish spouted by one who is not a fool.

33
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:48,507
But unfortunately, I have had one
comrade and he is all I ever intend to have.

34
00:04:48,827 --> 00:04:52,164
Furthermore, there is no need for there to be two kings.

35
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:55,023
The lonely path of kingship, eh?

36
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:57,347
With all respect due to a king,

37
00:04:57,606 --> 00:05:00,579
I shall challenge your strong unwavering spirit.

38
00:05:01,163 --> 00:05:04,116
Very well, show me what you think you can do,

39
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:05,500
King of Conquerors.

40
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:09,805
You are a usurper truly worthy of my judgment.

41
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:26,187
Are you guys actually friends with each other?

42
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,937
I could hardly be unfriendly to him.

43
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:34,624
After all, he may very well be the last person I ever see.

44
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:40,815
Don't be stupid, you're not gonna be killed here today.

45
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:42,245
I won't allow it!

46
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,288
Have you forgotten my command seal?

47
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,842
You are right, ha.

48
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:50,945
You are exactly right.

49
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:57,701
Gather here, my glorious comrades!

50
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:02,866
Tonight we shall become the
greatest legends in all of eternity!

51
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:20,548
Our enemy is the mighty King of Heroes,

52
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,220
a most worthy opponent.

53
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:27,044
My warriors, let us show the first heroic spirit

54
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:30,394
our noble path of ultimate conquest!

55
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:47,971
Come to me, Lord of Conquering armies.

56
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:52,328
Now you will be privileged to
behold the sight of a true king.

57
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:46,418
Why are you suffering so much?

58
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:50,517
Because of Berserker.

59
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:52,723
He must fight a battle right now,

60
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:54,373
and needs mana.

61
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:56,046
Why?

62
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:00,530
Because that priest said so.

63
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:03,556
That priest?

64
00:08:03,703 --> 00:08:04,690
Yeah.

65
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:09,362
He made a promise to me that he'd
give me the Grail once he got it.

66
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:15,110
If I have the Grail, I can save you, Sakura.

67
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,631
You're going to save me?

68
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:20,714
Yeah, of course.

69
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:25,128
Remember, I promised that we would all play together

70
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:28,108
like we used to with your mom and sister.

71
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:32,024
Then I'll be able to see Mother again?

72
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:35,092
See your mother.

73
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:05,797
Ahhh!

74
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:18,319
Now.

75
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:23,676
No good.

76
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:38,365
Can he see it?

77
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:53,516
He knows the lengths of my blade.

78
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:57,664
Could he be some knight I once knew?

79
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:02,991
From your skill I assume you
to be a knight of some renown,

80
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:07,518
and so I ask, if you know me to be Arturia Pendragon,

81
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:09,851
King of Britain and founder of Camelot...

82
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:14,710
...name yourself right now as a knight's pride demands.

83
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:19,224
Challenging me with your identity
concealed is tantamount to using deceit.

84
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:29,465
Who are you?

85
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:40,888
Impossible.

86
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:47,049
That's Arondight.

87
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:49,742
It can't be you.

88
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,169
Sir Lancelot.

89
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,431
But why, my friend?

90
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:28,488
You were esteemed as the greatest
of all the Knights of the Round Table.

91
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,690
How can you be Berserker?

92
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:36,049
Stop!

93
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:42,661
Lancelot.

94
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:53,280
You may indeed have saved them,

95
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:55,472
but you never led them.

96
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:59,218
Because I never really led them.

97
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:03,977
Enraptured by a false idol of a
humble king who always serves others.

98
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:06,763
My ideals, my kingship.

99
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,465
You're just a little girl.

100
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:11,108
Did how I rule drive you to this?

101
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:21,754
Please stop, Lancelot.

102
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:33,924
Uniting dreams beneath a banner of conquest.

103
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:36,212
I praise your efforts at least.

104
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:41,476
But foolish warriors, have you not learned?

105
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:47,319
Dreams disappear when the dreamer wakes,

106
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:50,281
every last one of them with no exception.

107
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:17,431
Therefore, it was inevitable that I
would be the one to stand in your way.

108
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:20,409
King of Conquerors,

109
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:24,338
now know the end of your eternal dream.

110
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:27,230
I shall show you the stark reality.

111
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,153
Here it comes!

112
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:33,803
Now, awaken Ea!

113
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:36,429
A stage worthy of you has been set!

114
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,971
Look up and behold, at my liege!

115
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,510
Hang on, boy!

116
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:00,980
What?

117
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:13,345
That sword is the Anti‐Universe Noble
Phantasm that can destroy all creation?

118
00:14:55,991 --> 00:14:56,412
Hm.

119
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:01,103
Rider.

120
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:09,822
I just remembered, there is something important

121
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,427
that I must ask you.

122
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,764
Master Waver Velvet,

123
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,764
would you be willing to serve as my retainer?

124
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,042
You...

125
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:33,537
...you are my king, sire.

126
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,511
I will serve you with devotion.

127
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:39,471
Do me the honor of leading me.

128
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,032
Let me dream what you dream.

129
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,789
Ah, very well.

130
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:57,888
As king, my duty is to inspire others to dream,

131
00:15:58,518 --> 00:16:05,868
and as my retainer, it is your sacred duty to see my
dream to the end and share it with future generations.

132
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:13,633
Now live, Waver.

133
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,695
See all of this through.

134
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:18,310
Live long and tell everyone you meet

135
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:20,989
of how your king comported himself,

136
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,685
of the last charge of Iskandar.

137
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:35,293
All right, it is time to go, Bucephalus!

138
00:16:38,808 --> 00:16:39,840
Rider!

139
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,608
Glory lies beyond the horizon.

140
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,603
Challenge the unattainable.

141
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:48,036
Speak of conquest and make it real

142
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,726
for my men and for those who watch behind me.

143
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,184
Hm.

144
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:02,606
I swear to the gods, it is just one
strange toy after another with you, isn't it?

145
00:18:08,017 --> 00:18:12,356
Have you awakened from your dream, King of Conquerors?

146
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,016
I suppose I have.

147
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:26,143
However, once again, during this glorious campaign,

148
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:30,964
my heart was able to dance a good deal.

149
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:39,284
Feel free to challenge me again as
often as you like, King of Conquerors.

150
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:47,386
This entire world is my garden until the very end of time.

151
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,643
Thus, I guarantee you this,

152
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:52,159
it will never bore you.

153
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,746
It will always be entertaining.

154
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:05,025
That sounds very good.

155
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:15,895
Now I see.

156
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,896
It was the beating of my heart

157
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:23,606
that was the sound of Oceanus' waves.

158
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:59,766
Child, are you Rider's master?

159
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,862
No, I'm not.

160
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,951
I am his retainer.

161
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:07,152
Hm?

162
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:08,820
I see.

163
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:15,567
But child, if you are truly a loyal subject to him,

164
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:18,866
your duty now is to avenge your fallen sovereign.

165
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:23,475
If I challenge you, I'll die.

166
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:25,375
Yes, of course you will.

167
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:27,625
I can't do that.

168
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:31,227
I was ordered by him to survive.

169
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:45,089
Your loyalty is splendid.

170
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:48,464
Never allow anything to tarnish it.

171
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,893
He restoreth my soul.

172
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:10,220
He leadeth me in paths of righteousness

173
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:12,255
for his name's sake.

174
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,082
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

175
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:19,403
I will fear no evil,

176
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:22,185
for thou art with me.

177
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:25,646
Thy rod and thy staff,

178
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:27,463
they comfort me.

179
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,217
Thou preparest a table before me.

180
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:32,848
Thou anointest my head with oil.

181
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,312
My cup runneth over.

182
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:40,260
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.

183
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:42,388
My cup runneth over.

184
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:47,308
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.

185
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:28,578
You would steal the Holy Grail from me?

186
00:23:28,603 --> 00:23:29,786
What're you doing, Saber?

187
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:31,659
What a difficult person you are.

188
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:34,623
It's impossible, the Grail longs for a life of its own,

189
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:36,145
longs for its own birth!

190
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:37,505
Welcome home, Daddy!

191
00:23:38,386 --> 00:23:40,426
I knew you would come, Kiritsugu.
