1
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:29,886
Kiritsugu.

2
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:05,104
I'm not dreaming, am I?

3
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:07,377
You really came?

4
00:02:07,888 --> 00:02:10,621
You really came to see me again.

5
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:13,657
Yes, that's right.

6
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:16,439
Thank you.

7
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:22,437
My last task

8
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:25,314
is to return this to you.

9
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:42,440
Take it.

10
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:47,861
From now on, you will be the
one who will be needing Avalon.

11
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,824
When you begin your final battle for the Grail,

12
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:53,581
I'm sure it will aid you.

13
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,069
You know what?

14
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,382
I'm really happy.

15
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:07,263
To love, to be loved.

16
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,463
To have a husband and daughter for nine whole years.

17
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:14,908
I'm grateful.

18
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,101
You gave me everything.

19
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:21,951
You gave me all the happiness in the world.

20
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:24,961
Something that was never meant for me.

21
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:31,153
I'm sorry, I wanted to show you much more of this world.

22
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:34,189
No, it was enough.

23
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:39,035
If there's still any happiness left to experience,

24
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:42,552
I want you to give it all to our sweet Ilya,

25
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:44,807
to your daughter.

26
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,118
Our angel, our beloved Ilya.

27
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,321
I want you to promise

28
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,962
to bring Ilya to this country someday.

29
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:03,497
Promise me that you'll show her everything
that I didn't get to see, amazing things.

30
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,406
Blossoming cherry trees,

31
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,088
and the summer clouds.

32
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:11,812
I will.

33
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,802
Okay, I have to go.

34
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,941
Yes, you be careful.

35
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:22,516
I love you.

36
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:34,435
Saber is heading to Rider's hideout right now.

37
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:35,857
Is that correct?

38
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:38,294
Yes, she's on her way.

39
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:41,317
I'm going to kill Tokiomi Tohsaka.

40
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:43,845
If Rider and Saber engage in battle

41
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,982
there's a good chance Archer will also appear.

42
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:48,484
I'll hit him there.

43
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,454
I want you to stay here and watch over Iri.

44
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:53,796
I understand.

45
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:56,757
Um, Kiritsugu.

46
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:01,104
Finally.

47
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:03,602
You look focused.

48
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:05,863
Just like you used to.

49
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:18,811
I don't feel a servant's presence.

50
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:50,922
There's no barrier?

51
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:53,420
What's going on?

52
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:01,042
So, is that good?

53
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:02,493
Nope, it's awful.

54
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:05,632
Guess Japanese cuisine isn't that good after all.

55
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:11,988
Boy, you walked right by Okonomiyaki Shoki
in Newtown without even stopping to look.

56
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:15,207
Their modanyaki was a thing of beauty.

57
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:17,382
Too bad you didn't pick up any of that.

58
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:22,378
If you wanna eat there again, you're gonna
have to recover enough so that you can materialize.

59
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:25,669
Do you recognize this spot?

60
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,362
This is the place where I summoned you.

61
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,063
It's the Fuyuki location with the
leylines that suit you best, remember?

62
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,387
You should be able to recover much more quickly here.

63
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:40,404
I've decided that I'm staying here all day.

64
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,001
Just sleeping, that's all.

65
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:45,662
So take my mana, as much as you want.

66
00:06:45,723 --> 00:06:46,753
Just don't kill me.

67
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,384
Maybe it'll help you feel a little bit better.

68
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,057
If you had already figured it out

69
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:57,252
you should've said something earlier.

70
00:06:57,413 --> 00:07:03,613
Finding out afterwards that someone's been onto you
the whole time is... well, well, it's a bit embarrassing.

71
00:07:03,893 --> 00:07:06,561
You idiot, you should've just told me about it!

72
00:07:07,142 --> 00:07:10,432
If you aren't at full strength
at the exact moment I need you

73
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:12,674
I'll be the one who ends up in danger.

74
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:19,706
Why didn't you say anything, Rider?

75
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:23,936
I thought that maybe I could
tough it out a little while longer,

76
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:27,941
but the fatigue from the river battle
has hit me harder than I expected.

77
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,262
Yeah, well, when it's all said and done,

78
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:34,339
your Noble Phantasm consumes a ton of power.

79
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:36,677
At first, I didn't really notice.

80
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:42,492
Because it wasn't affecting me I thought
it was all incredibly efficient or something.

81
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:50,692
Rider, honestly, instead of using
mana that was supposed to come from me,

82
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:53,849
you managed to use your own stored power, didn't you?

83
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:57,425
And not only that, you did it twice.

84
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,476
What's the big idea doing that?

85
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:03,509
Well, you know,

86
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:07,272
I mean, when you get right down to it, as a servant,

87
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:10,224
I'm a natural soul eater of sorts.

88
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,830
If I involve you when I expend mana at my maximum rate

89
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,829
it could put your life at serious risk.

90
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:19,650
Yeah, but I'm fine with that.

91
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:22,703
This is a battle that I got us into.

92
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:25,955
Unless I bleed or make sacrifices,

93
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,123
there's no point at all of winning this war.

94
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:31,207
Hmmm.

95
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:35,694
All I wanted was to prove myself,

96
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,295
that I could... that someone just like me

97
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:42,346
can take whatever it is he wants with his own two hands.

98
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:49,119
But boy, I hope you realize that all of
that only applies if the Grail truly exists.

99
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:52,412
You know, I once did something similar.

100
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:56,488
Fought ferociously for something
that might not have even existed.

101
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,344
Oceanus.

102
00:08:58,737 --> 00:08:59,901
That's right.

103
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:02,535
I said I'd show them Oceanus,

104
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:09,166
and they were so swept up by my story that they
all followed me on my quest without a single doubt.

105
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:12,135
Many died along the way,

106
00:09:12,247 --> 00:09:15,979
all dreaming of Oceanus until the very end.

107
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:19,874
When I gained this era's knowledge, it hit my really hard.

108
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:23,527
I'd had no idea the world was an enclosed sphere.

109
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:25,570
What a bad joke.

110
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:29,482
But even so, when I saw the map,

111
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:32,039
I had no choice but to accept it.

112
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:39,599
It seems I've had my fill of
letting people die for fairytales.

113
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:42,338
If the Grail's existence was certain,

114
00:09:42,737 --> 00:09:47,118
I'd have no objection to you risking
your life in an effort to possess it.

115
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:51,232
But unfortunately, that is not the case.

116
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,513
Even so...

117
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,714
don't you forget, I am still your master.

118
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:06,690
Boy, learned to talk back now, have you?

119
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:07,732
Excellent.

120
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:13,401
It's true, your magic circuits
are more powerful than usual.

121
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:19,168
If I rest all day I should be ready
to go another round come nightfall.

122
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:22,336
Oh yeah, another round?

123
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:25,009
What exactly are you planning to do next?

124
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,595
Hm, good question.

125
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:31,631
I'm thinking that we should begin with Saber.

126
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:34,693
At the rate you're regenerating,

127
00:10:34,762 --> 00:10:37,350
how much will you be able to recover by tonight?

128
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:41,017
If I only use the Gordius Wheel for flight,

129
00:10:41,284 --> 00:10:43,219
there really shouldn't be a problem.

130
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:50,377
However, I'm afraid I'll only be able to
employ my Ionioi Hetairoi one more time.

131
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:51,437
I see.

132
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,115
We should probably save it
for the later fight with Archer.

133
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:57,499
Then Rider, I don't get it.

134
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:00,593
Why is it you wanna fight Saber first?

135
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:05,092
I must defeat her, and no one else.

136
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:08,660
As a heroic spirit, it is my responsibility.

137
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:09,973
What's that mean?

138
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:13,954
If I don't show that silly girl the right path,

139
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,087
the path to true kingship,

140
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:18,335
I fear she'll never learn.

141
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,683
That would be too sad to bear thinking about.

142
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:24,904
Whatever, have it however you want.

143
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,167
Boy, quit keeping yourself awake and just go to sleep.

144
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:32,639
Rest is the battle that you face right now.

145
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:33,432
Mmm.

146
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:41,350
I am the shunned, the scorned,

147
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:44,460
the despised.

148
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,854
Who the hell are you?

149
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:50,469
My name is unworthy of praise.

150
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:52,971
My body unworthy of envy.

151
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:56,932
I am the shadow cast by the heroic spirits' light,

152
00:11:57,025 --> 00:12:00,460
the darkness born in the shadow of shining legend.

153
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:08,355
Thus do I hate,

154
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,030
thus do I resent.

155
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:17,906
I feed on the lamentation of those who sink into
darkness, and curse those who shine so brightly.

156
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,054
Her shadow is my shame.

157
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:25,017
Her honor remains forever unsullied.

158
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:28,263
Thus am I forever looked down upon.

159
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,543
You are the sacrifice.

160
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:46,138
Healing won't help me.

161
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:48,306
I'm going to die soon.

162
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:55,126
Damn it.

163
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:05,675
Really, what a sorry sight you
are. You look absolutely terrible.

164
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,470
Now I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

165
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:13,979
I'm not blaming you for your current condition.

166
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:18,983
To be perfectly honest, I never would've
imagined that you'd hold out for this long.

167
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:22,252
You've really surprised me, and so,

168
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:25,210
I shall give you the ace I've kept hidden up my sleeve,

169
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:29,086
secreted away for use at precisely this stage of the game.

170
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:30,254
Take it.

171
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:45,665
It works quickly, doesn't it?

172
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:48,602
The worm I just gave you is very special.

173
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,623
It was the first to feed on Sakura's innocent purity.

174
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:55,914
How does it feel, Kariya?

175
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:59,843
For an entire year it has been
devouring the girl's life energy.

176
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:02,212
It's a magnificent mana source.

177
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:05,562
Now, go back and fight, Kariya,

178
00:14:05,808 --> 00:14:10,125
and make good use of the precious life
force you've stolen from young Sakura.

179
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:15,221
Go and use every ounce of your flesh
and bone to acquire the Holy Grail,

180
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:19,413
if someone such as you is even capable of it, that is.

181
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,580
Hey, Maiya.

182
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:29,306
I'm curious as to why you fight for Kiritsugu.

183
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:33,470
Because I have nothing else in life.

184
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:37,403
I can't remember my family or my own name for that matter.

185
00:14:38,056 --> 00:14:42,355
Maiya Hisau was the name on the very first fake passport

186
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,263
that Kiritsugu made for me.

187
00:14:56,656 --> 00:15:02,080
All I remember is that the place where
I came from was a terribly poor country.

188
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:04,248
The wars never ended,

189
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:07,253
even though there was no money to maintain the armies.

190
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:10,497
But day after day, they continued to kill one another.

191
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,660
Then one day, someone had an idea.

192
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:16,058
Rather than conscript and train soldiers,

193
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:18,700
it was cheaper and faster to abduct children

194
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:21,018
and send them out to fight the battles.

195
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:23,072
You mean, you were one of them?

196
00:15:25,588 --> 00:15:27,734
Aim at the enemy and pull the trigger.

197
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:30,608
That was my sole function in life.

198
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:32,981
I threw everything else away.

199
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:36,193
As a human being, I'm dead inside,

200
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:39,356
but the outer shell continues to function.

201
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,355
Still working just like it did before.

202
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:47,171
That's always been my life, but
regardless, Kiritsugu took me in,

203
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:52,867
so however he wants to use me is fine
by me, and that's the reason I'm here.

204
00:15:55,119 --> 00:16:00,562
To tell you the truth, madam, it was
your passion for all this that surprised me.

205
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:04,099
You've been secluded in the castle where you were born,

206
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,786
knowing so little of the outside world.

207
00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:11,467
So I simply can't imagine why you would
fight this hard for Kiritsugu's dream.

208
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:14,156
To change a world you've never really seen.

209
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,960
Well, I... you're right.

210
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:22,588
I cannot truly understand Kiritsugu's ideals,

211
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:25,588
or why he holds them close to his heart.

212
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:31,219
It's as you say, I've been sheltered,

213
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:35,950
and I know practically nothing of the
world that Kiritsugu longs to change.

214
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:40,793
All the ideals I speak of are
merely words that I learned from him.

215
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,081
But please don't let him know that.

216
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:49,858
I've always told him that I
thought he was doing the right thing,

217
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:54,818
and also that those same ideals
were worth giving up my life for.

218
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:58,244
And I pretended that I understood him.

219
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:01,080
Then, madam, in that case,

220
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:03,688
have you no wish or longing of your own?

221
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,078
My wish?

222
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:07,800
Oh yes, I have one.

223
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:12,103
I wish for Kiritsugu and Saber

224
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:15,169
to prevail and win possession of the Holy Grail.

225
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:18,632
You mean, you support the Einzbern's desire

226
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,276
to attain the Third Magic?

227
00:17:20,796 --> 00:17:24,997
No, what I desire is an end to conflict in the world.

228
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:29,707
If Kiritsugu's wish comes true and
fighting everywhere comes to an end,

229
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:33,471
the battles for possession of
the Holy Grail here in Fuyuki

230
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:35,357
will be no exception.

231
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:40,497
I want this fourth battle to be
the last of the Holy Grail Wars.

232
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:43,532
You mean, for your daughter?

233
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,573
If Kiritsugu and I fail to get the Grail,

234
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:49,623
then Ilya's next.

235
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:56,838
It's unfortunate, but that is the destiny
that an Einzbern homunculus must bear.

236
00:17:57,153 --> 00:18:00,112
So my wish is to be the last one.

237
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:05,730
If that comes true she'll be able to
live out her life as a normal human being.

238
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:12,806
Maiya, what will you do after Kiritsugu
reaches his goal and saves the world?

239
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,449
I don't expect to survive that long.

240
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:17,513
And even if I do,

241
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,892
there'll be no reason for me to exist anymore.

242
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,102
I'm sure it will be that kind of world

243
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,868
once Kiritsugu changes it.

244
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:30,007
But you do have a reason to exist.

245
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:31,311
You think so?

246
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:36,085
You must look for your real name,
and then go out and find your family.

247
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:39,322
Those aren't things anyone should forget.

248
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:44,187
You must learn who you are and etch
yourself into the memories of others.

249
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,564
So live, Maiya,

250
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,332
for yourself and for me too.

251
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:56,604
I'll do my best, but all that has
to wait until after the battle ends.

252
00:18:57,152 --> 00:19:00,851
Right now we must be cautious. Both he and I

253
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:03,402
must stay on constant guard.

254
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,316
The one who died was Tokiomi Tohsaka.

255
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:14,618
Oh, Maiya, you really are stubborn.

256
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:33,970
Maiya!

257
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:35,323
Iri!

258
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:39,306
By my command seal, I order you!

259
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:43,638
Saber, go to the storehouse immediately!

260
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:44,892
Kiritsugu.

261
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:50,007
What happened?

262
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:53,258
Maiya!

263
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,076
Saber.

264
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:02,267
Don't try to speak.

265
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,719
Hurry, follow him.

266
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:09,006
Don't let him escape with her.

267
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:11,939
Rider took madam with him.

268
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,623
But if I leave...

269
00:20:13,883 --> 00:20:15,078
Don't worry.

270
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:17,304
I'll be just fine.

271
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,310
And Kiritsugu will come soon.

272
00:20:20,713 --> 00:20:22,685
So, hurry.

273
00:20:28,785 --> 00:20:33,095
Maiya, you have to try and
hold on until Kiritsugu returns.

274
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:36,137
I shall bring Irisviel back safe.

275
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:53,624
Rider, I can't believe it.

276
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:21,974
It was Rider.

277
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:27,161
Yes, I understand.

278
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:33,044
You mustn't cry, not over me.

279
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:40,064
You need to save those tears for your wife.

280
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,282
You can't cry here.

281
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,593
Be strong, you have to finish.

282
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:48,079
So don't cry yet.

283
00:21:48,783 --> 00:21:50,008
You can't break.

284
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,129
You can't.

285
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:53,422
Maiya.

286
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,374
You know, this morning, you finally
looked like Kiritsugu, like your old self.

287
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,261
Don't lose your resolve over this.

288
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:04,328
Promise.

289
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:10,564
Don't worry, Maiya.

290
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:13,347
Leave the rest to Saber.

291
00:22:14,323 --> 00:22:17,153
Maiya, your task here

292
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:19,314
is finished.

293
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:31,240
Maiya.

294
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:39,224
Maiya?

295
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:14,429
Where is Irisviel?

296
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:17,019
Don't forget now, tonight at midnight.

297
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,885
Nothing on Earth can stop me!

298
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,798
Do not underestimate me!

299
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:21,892
It was all his fault!

300
00:24:21,986 --> 00:24:23,340
If it weren't for what he did!

301
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:25,140
Oh, scary, scary.

302
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,506
Are you satisfied now, Kariya?
