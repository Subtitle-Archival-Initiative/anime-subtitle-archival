1
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:05,346
By my third command seal, I order you again.

2
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:08,012
Stop!

3
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:10,530
Now, Saber, destroy

4
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:12,042
the Holy Grail.

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,448
How could I possibly hope to know a man

6
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:23,095
from merely three commands alone?

7
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,591
I, I never even knew the hearts of those

8
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,129
who served me well,

9
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:31,468
and were closest to me.

10
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:39,763
Perhaps all this was a punishment meted out to a king

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,312
who cannot understand others.

12
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:23,319
That can't...

13
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:44,168
It can't be.

14
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:46,428
It's impossible!

15
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,983
Daddy?

16
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,536
Ilyasviel, what's wrong?

17
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,997
I had a really scary dream.

18
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:26,178
A dream where,

19
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:30,156
where I become a really big cup...

20
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:36,949
...and then I dreamed that these seven
gigantic lumps started to come into my body.

21
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:40,970
It felt like they were gonna tear me apart.

22
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:43,367
It's really scary,

23
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:46,335
but I can't run away.

24
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:52,273
And then I hear the voice of Lord Justice.

25
00:02:53,148 --> 00:03:00,862
After that, a big black hole opens up
above my head, and then the world burns.

26
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:04,901
Daddy looks at it all

27
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:08,231
and just begins to cry.

28
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:14,300
Mother, is Daddy okay?

29
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,704
Is he scared and alone?

30
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,825
Is he in trouble?

31
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:20,945
It's okay.

32
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,535
Daddy's doing the best he can for you.

33
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:28,042
He'll make certain that our prayers are realized

34
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,875
so you'll never have to be scared again, Ilyasviel.

35
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:37,031
That's right.

36
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:39,178
I know he will.

37
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,341
Daddy always works very hard.

38
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:49,771
He'll finish all of his important work, and
he'll come home as soon as he possibly can.

39
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:58,769
Hey, Sakura.

40
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,187
Come on.

41
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,058
Uncle?

42
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,229
I'm here to save you.

43
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:05,843
It's okay now.

44
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,070
Let's go.

45
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,318
It's Sakura!

46
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:15,832
Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!

47
00:04:21,974 --> 00:04:22,938
Kariya.

48
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:29,043
Hi, Aoi.

49
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,823
Thank you, Uncle Kariya.

50
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:34,902
Thank you so much.

51
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,094
Daddy Kariya!

52
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:56,903
You're such a fool.

53
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,215
Never disobey Grandfather.

54
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:08,248
Where am I?

55
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:11,147
You're a difficult man to look after.

56
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,858
Digging you out from underneath all of
this rubble was quite a troublesome endeavor.

57
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:21,037
Gilgamesh, what happened?

58
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:23,086
Who can say?

59
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,641
That mud spit me out and here I am.

60
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:29,341
I imagine it to be an obvious message from heaven

61
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:32,791
that I should return to this age to rule the world.

62
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:36,393
Are you saying you have achieved incarnation?

63
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:39,245
Infuriatingly enough.

64
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,943
I can't believe we struggled over that ridiculous
thing as if it were actually a wish‐granter.

65
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:52,118
This ill‐conceived and disappointing play
remained a meaningless farce right to the very end.

66
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,639
But I was shot.

67
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:56,376
I don't get it.

68
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:02,823
I have no heartbeat.

69
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:09,221
Did you somehow heal me and
bring me back to life, Gilgamesh?

70
00:06:09,842 --> 00:06:12,326
The fact is I really have no idea.

71
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,136
To my eyes, you still seem quite dead,

72
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,300
but the two of us were connected by our pact.

73
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,824
When I regained flesh within that mud,

74
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:26,635
perhaps you were trapped in some
sort of magical nonsense of your own.

75
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,316
Impossible, you're saying that thing granted me life?

76
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,956
All the other servants are gone,

77
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:38,380
so I suppose we must be the ones who have won the Grail.

78
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:42,859
Kirei, behold the result of our victory.

79
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:47,962
If it is true that the Grail
grants the victor's heartfelt wish,

80
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:52,587
what you see before you, Kirei Kotomine, is your wish.

81
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:55,398
It is exactly what you most desired.

82
00:07:05,128 --> 00:07:05,456
Hm?

83
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:12,996
This is it, what the hell does this make me?

84
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:14,945
What manner of dark evil?

85
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:17,095
What manner of cruelty?

86
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:19,801
This, this is my wish?

87
00:07:20,195 --> 00:07:22,663
This horrible destruction and tragedy?

88
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:25,106
This is the joy I sought?

89
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:28,770
Could something so twisted, so corrupt,

90
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:32,943
have truly sprung forth from
the seed of Father Risei Kotomine?

91
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,788
No way, it is impossible!

92
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:43,542
Did my father sire a soulless demon
more evil than the devil himself?

93
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:51,774
Are you satisfied now, Kirei?

94
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:54,720
No, no, not yet.

95
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:57,351
This isn't nearly enough.

96
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:02,778
Yes, it is true that my life of questions

97
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:04,861
has finally found its answer.

98
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:10,444
However, the problem solving
process itself was skipped over,

99
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:13,208
and the solution was just simply handed to me.

100
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:17,332
How is it that I'm supposed to
accept all this at face value?

101
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:24,917
The formula that yielded this strange,
unsettling answer should exist somewhere

102
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:27,216
as a greater, clearer principle

103
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:28,620
one can understand.

104
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:33,031
No, not should, it must.

105
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,237
I must question, I must search.

106
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:41,360
I must dedicate the remainder of my life

107
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:44,296
to fully understanding it.

108
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:47,320
You know, you never fail to bore me.

109
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:52,828
As you like, your questions would slay the very gods.

110
00:08:53,502 --> 00:08:56,145
I shall watch you seek out your answer.

111
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:01,419
Angra Mainyu.

112
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:06,139
I will reach it again, and next time,

113
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,325
I will see it to the end.

114
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:12,962
Its birth and the proof of its existence.

115
00:09:23,324 --> 00:09:25,954
Kiritsugu Emiya.

116
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:31,268
I accept your challenge.

117
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:49,222
What's the matter, Kirei?

118
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:51,822
Nothing.

119
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:07,758
I remember the look on his face,

120
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:10,595
the tears in his eyes

121
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,986
over finding someone alive in the rubble.

122
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:16,879
A man filled with joy

123
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:19,338
from the bottom of his heart.

124
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,915
He looked so happy to me.

125
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:29,735
It was almost as though it had been him
who had been saved that day, and not me.

126
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:34,860
He's alive, he's alive!

127
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:36,566
He's alive!

128
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:44,608
And then, so fervently that even as I teetered
on the brink of death, I felt jealous of him.

129
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:48,311
He said, "Thank you,"

130
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:52,772
that he was glad he'd found someone,

131
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:55,689
that by saving even one person

132
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,522
he had saved himself.

133
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:12,570
And now for our next story, the explosion that occurred...

134
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:16,632
I hope that Alexey made it back
to his home in England safely.

135
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,535
He called me this morning from Heathrow Airport.

136
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:22,571
That idiot forgot all about the time difference.

137
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:24,244
Oh, he called?

138
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:26,014
I didn't hear the phone ring,

139
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:29,844
but then, it's just like him to do that.

140
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,141
Hey, Grandpa and Grandma,

141
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:40,910
I have a favor to ask, if it's okay.

142
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:44,495
What is it, Waver, speak your mind.

143
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:48,472
Actually, I'm thinking of
taking some time off from school.

144
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:52,231
Of course I'll talk to Dad in Toronto about it first.

145
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:56,417
There's something that I wanna spend
my time on more than studies at school.

146
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:57,878
Oh?

147
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,158
My goodness.

148
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:02,052
But what brought all this on, dear?

149
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:05,320
Is it school, you aren't fed up with it, are you?

150
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:06,940
No, it's not that.

151
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:14,133
You see, so far I haven't really been
interested in anything besides studying.

152
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:15,833
I'm regretting that a little.

153
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:19,624
And so...

154
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,868
I'd like to do some traveling.

155
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:28,008
Oh my, did you hear that, Glen, my dear?

156
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:33,442
Waver just said something that sounded
exactly like something Alexey would say.

157
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:36,626
Anyway, there's a lot I'd have to do first,

158
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,681
and I'll need money to do it too.

159
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:42,134
For starters, I was thinking of finding a part‐time job.

160
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:45,204
And so, um,

161
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,256
to make a long story a lot shorter,

162
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,428
if you wouldn't mind too much,

163
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:58,541
could I possibly stay here
until I get everything worked out?

164
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:01,667
Of course you can, Waver, dear.

165
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,970
It will be so wonderful to have you
live here with us for a while longer.

166
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,215
We'll have to celebrate today.

167
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:17,382
Oh, look at this.

168
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:23,302
He was just a spirit, so I don't get how
he could've possibly left such a mess behind.

169
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:34,932
I really did want him to take me with him.

170
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:40,391
I guess it basically means that I'm just not there yet.

171
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:41,760
I'm not ready.

172
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:52,638
He never even got the chance to open this.

173
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:53,959
Too bad.

174
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:10,910
A limited edition with an original t‐shirt.

175
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:14,535
Does anyone even want stuff like this?

176
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:17,861
What an idiot.

177
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,979
I know that my redeemer lives,

178
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,019
and that in the end,

179
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:36,610
he will stand upon the earth.

180
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,596
And though, after my skin worms destroy this body,

181
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:44,780
yet in my flesh shall I see God.

182
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:47,896
I myself will see him

183
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,366
with mine own eyes.

184
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:53,085
I am not another.

185
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:56,291
How my heart yearns within me.

186
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,431
Amen.

187
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:08,136
Rin, it was an excellent debut for
the young new head of the Tohsaka family.

188
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:12,193
Your late father would've been
very pleased with you today.

189
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:13,597
Well done.

190
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:18,888
You haven't quite grown fully
accustomed to your crest yet I see.

191
00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:20,750
Does it hurt?

192
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:24,245
It's nothing, I'm fine.

193
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:28,597
It seems that Tokiomi's
preparations for you were flawless.

194
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:33,147
I imagine that all the magic the
Tohsaka family has accumulated, Rin,

195
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:35,606
will pass to you without incident.

196
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:40,333
Well, why don't you go and fetch your mother now?

197
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,911
Yes, I'll do that.

198
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:50,619
Come on, Mother, let's say our last goodbye to Father.

199
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:57,293
Rin, is it someone's funeral today?

200
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:00,390
That's right, Mother, Father died.

201
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:02,638
Oh dear.

202
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:06,754
Then I should take out Tokiomi's black suit.

203
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:11,156
Oh, and Rin, help Sakura get changed, will you?

204
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:16,749
My, what should I do? I have
to get myself ready to go too.

205
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:20,768
Goodness, dear, your necktie isn't on straight.

206
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,607
You need to look good.

207
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:28,777
After all, you're the father of Sakura and Rin.

208
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:34,335
I have to go away, I'll be
leaving Japan again for a while.

209
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,926
Do you have any immediate concerns?

210
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:41,323
None at all, I don't need your help for anything.

211
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,008
We will next meet six months from now.

212
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:47,916
At that time, I will conduct
the second crest transplantation.

213
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,579
Take care that you are in peak
physical condition when I return.

214
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:54,251
I know, you don't need to tell me.

215
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:59,605
Rin, you are now the head of the
Tohsaka family both in name and reality,

216
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,898
and to commemorate this day,

217
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:05,015
I'd like to offer you a very special gift.

218
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,018
An Azoth dagger.

219
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:14,401
When my master acknowledged the results of
my training and declared it finally complete,

220
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,247
he presented this to me.

221
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:20,507
But given the circumstances, I think you should have it.

222
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:24,978
This was my father's?

223
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:55,637
I'm here again.

224
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:02,928
Everyone...

225
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:08,649
Lance... Lancelot.

226
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,883
Because I could not stop myself from loving Guinevere,

227
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,794
I was never able to forgive myself.

228
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:27,670
But, King Arthur,

229
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,071
you never once spoke of my many sins.

230
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:34,453
You never sought atonement from me.

231
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:39,172
You simply continued to stand
before us in your righteousness.

232
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:42,182
But deep in my heart

233
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,879
I desired judgment at your hands.

234
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:47,234
Had your anger judged me,

235
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:49,647
had your righteousness condemned me,

236
00:18:49,822 --> 00:18:57,137
I might not have fallen onto the path of madness,
and my quest to atone and save my immortal soul.

237
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:59,417
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

238
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:01,165
I...

239
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:04,535
I am unworthy.

240
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:08,070
But this much I can say with certainty.

241
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,278
King Arthur.

242
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,220
One day, friend,

243
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:14,717
I will claim the Grail.

244
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:19,502
You were the greatest of all kings who ever lived.

245
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:24,621
All of those at the Round Table who served you...

246
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,578
It was not I.

247
00:19:27,673 --> 00:19:31,353
Felt the same as I did.

248
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:36,381
I shouldn't have been king.

249
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:48,196
After that day, I visited the Einzberns many times.

250
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,342
But as I had not returned with the Grail,

251
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:55,085
Jubstacheit never opened the forest's barrier for me.

252
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:59,590
And so, I never saw Ilya again.

253
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,875
However, I swore

254
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:11,445
that Ilyasviel would be the
final person I would ever lose.

255
00:20:13,742 --> 00:20:16,523
My life was meant to be one solely of loss.

256
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:20,382
But everyone is still here,

257
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,058
just like when we met.

258
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:30,140
Once I was able, I adopted my son Shirou,

259
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,114
the little boy I saved that day.

260
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:35,975
Hey.

261
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:39,192
Hey, old man!

262
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,238
Hm?

263
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:44,240
If you're so tired you're gonna fall asleep, go to bed!

264
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:45,508
Huh?

265
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:49,446
Right, I'm fine.

266
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:54,828
When I was little,

267
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,290
I really wanted to be a hero.

268
00:20:58,475 --> 00:20:59,823
What are you talking about?

269
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:01,773
You don't want to anymore?

270
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:03,584
Did you just give up?

271
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,852
Yeah, unfortunately.

272
00:21:08,997 --> 00:21:11,481
Seems that wish has an expiration date.

273
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:14,985
When you grow up, it's hard to call yourself one.

274
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,601
I wish I'd realized that sooner.

275
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:24,444
I see, well, guess there's nothing you can do about it.

276
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,765
Yeah, right.

277
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:29,273
I guess not.

278
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:39,024
It really is a nice moon tonight.

279
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:43,098
Fine, since you can't do it,

280
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:46,331
I'm gonna be a hero for you.

281
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:47,714
Hm?

282
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:51,840
You're an adult now, so you can't
do it anymore, but I still can.

283
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,413
Just leave it to me.

284
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,608
I'll make it happen.

285
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:08,386
All right.

286
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,444
You do that.

287
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:18,934
I can rest easy now.

288
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:26,746
Tell me, Kerry, what do you wanna grow up to be?

289
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:29,706
Well...

290
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,416
what I wanna be

291
00:22:34,642 --> 00:22:35,535
is a hero.
