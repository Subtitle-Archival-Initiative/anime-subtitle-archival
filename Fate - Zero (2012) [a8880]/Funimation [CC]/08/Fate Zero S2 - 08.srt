1
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:13,081
Irisviel.

2
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:17,742
Have I lost them?

3
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,306
If I can't see them anymore, then I'll sense them.

4
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:27,660
A chariot?

5
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,813
I have you now, Rider.

6
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:39,306
Hey, Rider, check it out!

7
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,413
Doesn't it seem like she's following us?

8
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,680
Well, well, if it isn't Saber herself.

9
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:50,150
This saves us having to search for her.

10
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:52,192
Hey, boy, tell me something.

11
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:55,767
Motorcycles don't usually travel that fast, do they?

12
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,929
A motorcycle, that thing?

13
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,679
No, no way, that's impossible!

14
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,108
Of course, with Saber's skill at riding,
we don't really know what it can do.

15
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:08,101
This will be fun!

16
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:13,034
Well, I will also have to do my part to
make this exchange with her interesting.

17
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,309
Huh... we're going down?

18
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,459
Change of plans.

19
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:20,353
I shall use an ordinary race
to settle things with the girl.

20
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:25,204
Yah!

21
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:27,893
Whoa!

22
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:32,787
I'm okay, but just try and be careful, okay?

23
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:34,875
Don't worry!

24
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,909
Nothing in heaven or on Earth
can stop me from being victorious!

25
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,087
Yah!

26
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,330
This is bad.

27
00:03:57,877 --> 00:03:59,617
I'm reaching the machine's limits.

28
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,455
At this rate...

29
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:05,489
and I'm so close.

30
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,498
Invisible Air!

31
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:34,827
No way.

32
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:43,149
She's closing the gap!

33
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,837
She's gonna catch up to us!

34
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:50,164
Ha... a mechanical contraption
like that going so fast is splendid!

35
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:53,363
But this is a battle chariot we are riding.

36
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:55,970
It's a fair race, but it needn't be polite!

37
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,892
This is what you get if you want to chase Iskander!

38
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:23,020
Excellent!

39
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:25,777
You really are the proud King of Knights.

40
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:29,250
Truly the beautiful flower of the battlefield!

41
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:34,429
Do not underestimate me!

42
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:56,258
Rider!

43
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,769
Prepare yourself!

44
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,820
Irisviel isn't here?

45
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:19,611
Impossible.

46
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:22,694
That was definitely Rider.

47
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:25,980
So then where is she?

48
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:34,689
Did you really think you could
trick me by imitating a servant?

49
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:40,355
Rider's master lacks the intel‐gathering
skills to have found that place.

50
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:44,009
Tohsaka could not possibly have attacked in his state.

51
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:46,207
And so, by process of elimination,

52
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,389
only the Matous could have abducted Irisviel.

53
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:54,982
Answer me, where is Irisviel?

54
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,559
I don't know!

55
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:58,530
I don't know anything!

56
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:01,276
Then where is Kariya Matou?

57
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,529
Kariya?

58
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:05,259
I have no idea where that fool is!

59
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:11,168
I don't know... I really don't know anything!

60
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,696
He left this morning with some guy who
said he was the overseer from the church!

61
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:19,655
Did you see Overseer?

62
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:22,580
Hmm.

63
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:28,111
Kirei Kotomine.

64
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:36,282
I didn't expect the real Rider to suddenly appear there.

65
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:39,081
Truly a fortuitous development.

66
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,633
You seem to have been blessed by good luck.

67
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:46,559
It favors you on the battlefield, Kariya Matou.

68
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:50,394
Father, was this deception

69
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:55,032
really worth the use of two of my three command seals?

70
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,140
You don't need to worry about that, Kariya.

71
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,646
Now, hold out your hand.

72
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:14,451
As long as you work with me,

73
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:17,976
you may use your command seals
without the slightest hesitation.

74
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:22,557
Hmm, very impressive.

75
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:25,799
A transformation ability of all things.

76
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:34,014
His Noble Phantasm is far too good
for someone of the Berserker class.

77
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:36,738
There are lots of stories of him succeeding

78
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:40,779
by disguising himself as another
knight in pursuit of some heroic deed.

79
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:45,326
Even with the command seals, this is the best result?

80
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:50,614
Your servant's obsessive
fixation on Saber is awe‐inspiring.

81
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:53,637
Enough, be gone Berserker!

82
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:04,361
This woman, is she really the vessel for the Holy Grail?

83
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:07,511
More accurately, her insides are.

84
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:10,259
Don't worry about a thing, Kariya.

85
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:14,679
As promised, I shall gladly give you the Holy Grail.

86
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:19,740
But before that, there is the
other promise you made to me, Father.

87
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:24,003
Oh, that...  everything is arranged.

88
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:27,973
At midnight tonight, go to the Fuyuki Church.

89
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:31,057
You will find Tokiomi Tohsaka there.

90
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,339
Don't forget, now, Kariya.

91
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:42,165
Tonight at midnight, your wish will be fulfilled.

92
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:51,388
Now then, I've sent Kariya away.

93
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,215
I don't know who you are,

94
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:55,715
but I suggest you show yourself now.

95
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:00,810
Ah, you sensed me.

96
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:04,355
You are indeed a veteran inquisitor.

97
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:07,523
So you're Zouken Matou.

98
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:09,162
That's correct.

99
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,590
Rider, are you sure?

100
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:19,237
We're really going to attack from right here?

101
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,573
From this range?

102
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:22,625
Straight ahead?

103
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:27,840
The sword of light we saw her use against Caster

104
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:29,861
has a delay before activation.

105
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:31,644
We'll strike then.

106
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,411
Why would you do something so crazy?

107
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,625
Precisely because it is, boy.

108
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,315
If she loses after all this,

109
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:43,534
her defeat will be bitterly devastating and complete.

110
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:48,385
She may even change her mind and
decide to be my vassal after all.

111
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:51,357
You wanna win her that badly.

112
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:55,733
Right now, on the battlefield, she
is like a star fallen down to Earth.

113
00:10:56,412 --> 00:11:02,124
Only as a part of my glorious army will she
truly be able to shine in her full brilliance!

114
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:09,494
In all his campaigns, he was never
interested in his opponent's power or wealth.

115
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:12,476
Without destroying or degrading them,

116
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:15,261
he sought to rule their very souls,

117
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:18,949
thus was he the King of Conquerors.

118
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:21,631
Very well, Rider.

119
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:24,035
Win by whatever means you wish.

120
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,415
Boy, it seems you are finally beginning
to understand the meaning of conquest.

121
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,387
Glory lies beyond the horizon!

122
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:37,750
Let us go now!

123
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:40,723
Via Expugnatio

124
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:43,087
Wind!

125
00:11:58,867 --> 00:11:59,634
Ex...

126
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:04,421
...calibur!

127
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,440
What is it you want, Zouken Matou?

128
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:20,836
Well, to tell you the truth,

129
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:27,215
I was quite interested to see what sort of
clever deception you would employ to destroy Kariya.

130
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,886
You would let the Matous's chance at victory slip away?

131
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,580
Actually, the sheer pleasure of watching Kariya suffer...

132
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:41,501
is something I shall never tire of.

133
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:45,613
Victory for the Matous or a miserable end for him,

134
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:48,761
it's a difficult choice.

135
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:49,588
Hmm.

136
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:54,429
So, you enjoy watching your own
flesh and blood suffer like that.

137
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:56,120
Indeed.

138
00:12:56,297 --> 00:13:00,254
I would've thought that you of all
people would understand that sentiment.

139
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,091
How so?

140
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,975
Well, you give off exactly the same scent as I do.

141
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:15,987
That of a hungry, wiggling little maggot
irresistibly attracted by the rotting meat of Kariya.

142
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,650
Oh, scary, scary!

143
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,667
You are truly a dog of the church.

144
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:26,815
I tease you at my own peril, eh?

145
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,971
I can assure you that we shall
see each other again, young one.

146
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:32,964
By the next time we meet,

147
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:35,622
see to it that you've allowed your true nature

148
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:40,575
to fully ripen, so that you and
I might fight on an equal footing.

149
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,316
Hmm.

150
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,763
Rider?

151
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,433
I'm sorry, boy.

152
00:14:09,997 --> 00:14:11,355
I screwed up.

153
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:18,790
Rider, use Ionian Hetairoi!

154
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:24,893
The chariot is all I will use against Saber.

155
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:27,928
I understand, but still.

156
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:43,603
Wait, she left.

157
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:46,080
A motorcycle... hmm.

158
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:47,564
It's magnificent.

159
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:48,737
What the hell?

160
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:51,677
Those are your first words after she's defeated you?

161
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:56,039
By the way...

162
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:57,005
Huh?

163
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,491
...how are we supposed to get back to town?

164
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:04,814
Well, I suppose we'll have to walk.

165
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:06,740
I was afraid of that.

166
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,839
How many more days do I have?

167
00:15:17,564 --> 00:15:19,613
How many more times can I fight?

168
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:30,229
But I can't die now.

169
00:15:32,617 --> 00:15:33,695
Not yet.

170
00:15:57,274 --> 00:15:59,872
Tokiomi Tohsaka!

171
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,991
So did you think you killed me, Tokiomi?

172
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,817
Well, you blew it.

173
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,120
Until I make you pay for that,

174
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:19,561
I'll keep coming back to...

175
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,260
Tohsaka!

176
00:16:58,053 --> 00:16:59,056
What?

177
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:02,137
Kariya?

178
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:07,754
Aoi?

179
00:17:08,553 --> 00:17:10,451
No, wait, it wasn't me!

180
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,064
He was...

181
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:56,680
Are you satisfied now, Kariya?

182
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,690
Now that Matous are sure to win the Holy Grail War?

183
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:07,824
But I... I didn't.

184
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,790
Why?

185
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:14,573
Ripping Sakura completely out of my life wasn't enough?

186
00:18:15,252 --> 00:18:18,305
Of all the cruel things you could've done,

187
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:20,829
you had to kill him right in front of me?

188
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,776
Why?

189
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:27,349
But he... it was all his fault!

190
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:28,884
If it weren't for what he did,

191
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:30,790
no one would've ever had to suffer!

192
00:18:31,054 --> 00:18:32,879
You, Aoi, or Sakura!

193
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,062
You could've had a happy life!

194
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:39,477
You shut your mouth!

195
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,397
What could you...

196
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:45,344
what could you possibly know about it?

197
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:47,065
You...

198
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:50,612
you've never...

199
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,810
You've never loved anyone in your entire life!

200
00:19:00,124 --> 00:19:01,585
There was someone I loved.

201
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,269
She was warm and kind.

202
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:07,158
I wanted her to be happier than anyone else.

203
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:09,885
For her, I would lay down my life.

204
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:14,200
That's why I've endured this pain until now.

205
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:19,780
Endured, endured, endured, endured,
endured, endured, endured it all!

206
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:22,394
I can't let her deny everything I've been through.

207
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:25,119
A lie, a lie, a lie, I do have someone...

208
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,620
there is someone in this world that I love!

209
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:29,274
Who did I do this for?

210
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:30,796
Whose fault is it?

211
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:33,757
If I'm going to die, I may as well!

212
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,849
Hmm, it was trite and full of clichés,

213
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:05,589
but still, I have to say, not bad for your first script.

214
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:13,100
Well, Kirei?

215
00:21:13,424 --> 00:21:15,097
What are your impressions?

216
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:25,016
It seems the taste of wine changes

217
00:21:26,264 --> 00:21:28,886
far more than I ever expected.

218
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:37,441
Well, then I believe that you're finally beginning
to know what it means to expand your horizons.

219
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,561
If it will taste as wonderful as this has,

220
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:48,513
then I would dearly love

221
00:21:49,294 --> 00:21:51,259
to sample it once again.

222
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,978
Waver Velvet orders you!

223
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:29,465
Keep your eyes open to the end!

224
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,620
For tonight, I shan't be holding back.

225
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:33,798
I'll just out‐maneuver and eliminate him quickly.

226
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:35,426
How do he and I differ?

227
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,055
If he does not doubt, then what is he?

228
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,113
If I'm here, who am I?
