15
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:34,926
Mom! Mom! I've been chosen!

16
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,630
I'm an elite pilot, chosen to
protect all of mankind!

17
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,211
I'm the best in the world!

18
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,101
It's supposed to be a secret!

19
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,942
But I'll tell you anyway! Just for you!

20
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,306
Everyone will be nice to us from now on!

21
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,007
So, we won't be lonely anymore!

22
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:53,427
So, we'll be fine, even without Dad around!
We won't be lonely anymore!

23
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,581
So, look! Look at me!

24
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:58,951
Come on, Mom!

25
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,131
Synch rate, zero...

26
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,465
Not qualified to be the Second Child...

27
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,576
There's no reason for me to exist anymore.

28
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,737
Because no one will look at me now.

29
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,348
Not Dad, not Mom, not anyone.

30
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,390
There's no reason for me to live now.

31
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,984
Asuka Langley Sohryu, correct?

32
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,954
Intelligence Division 2 reports that they have
the Second Child safely in their custody.

33
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,025
I see.

34
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:43,929
It isn't like Division 2 to take seven days to
find her on top of losing her in the first place.

35
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,765
It's probably on purpose.

36
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,501
Maybe they're trying to spite us
here in the Tactical Division.

37
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,612
Possibly.

38
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,739
And today, Asuka's replacement,
the Fifth Child, arrives.

39
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,350
Everything is just too perfect.

40
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,794
Rei Ayanami...

41
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,858
So, that feeling I got really was her.

42
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,705
Like Mother...

43
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,017
Rei Ayanami and Mother...

44
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,331
What are you doing, Father?

45
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:19,849
Commander Ikari...

46
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,171
The cat died.

47
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,504
The one I'd left in my grandmother's care.

48
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,707
I hadn't paid any attention to her for so long,

49
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,318
but now, suddenly, I'll never see her again.

50
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,532
Why did you destroy the dummy system?

51
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,335
Not the dummy system,
what I destroyed was Rei.

52
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,096
I will only ask you this once. Why?

53
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,025
Because I am no longer happy,
even when you make love to me.

54
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,293
Why don't you just have your way
with my body?!

55
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,561
Like you did that time!

56
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,464
I'm disappointed in you.

57
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,798
Disappointed?!

58
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,534
You never hoped or expected anything
from me to begin with!

59
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,375
Nothing from me! Not anything! Nothing!

60
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,769
What am I supposed to do, Mother?

61
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,750
I wonder where Asuka is?

62
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,857
But what would be the point in seeing her?

63
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,487
Talk to her about Ayanami or something?

64
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:28,736
Everyone, including Toji and Kensuke,
lost their homes and left.

65
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,260
My friends...

66
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,315
I don't have anyone I can
call a friend anymore.

67
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,328
There's no one.

68
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,345
I can't go see Ayanami.

69
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,313
I don't have the courage for it.

70
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,274
I don't know how I'm supposed to face her.

71
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,588
Asuka, Miss Misato, Mother...

72
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,045
What should I...

73
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,024
What should I do?

74
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,942
Singing is great.

75
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,407
Singing enriches the soul.

76
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,404
It's the crowning achievement of the
civilization that the Lilim created.

77
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,813
Don't you feel the same?

78
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,256
Shinji Ikari?

79
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,091
My name...

80
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,960
Everyone knows your name.

81
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,295
I don't mean to be rude,

82
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:32,064
but I think you should be a little more
aware of your position.

83
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,495
You think so?

84
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,634
Who are you?

85
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,565
I'm Kaworu, Kaworu Nagisa.

86
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,439
One of the children that's part of
the design, just like you.

87
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,974
I'm the Fifth Child.

88
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,475
The Fifth Child?

89
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,466
You are? Nagisa?

90
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,514
You can just call me Kaworu, Ikari.

91
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,945
You can call me Shinji too.

92
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,301
It appears the Fifth Child has just arrived.

93
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,360
Kaworu Nagisa, his past records
have already been erased.

94
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,028
The same as Rei...

95
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,899
But the one thing we do know is that his
birthday coincides with the Second Impact.

96
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,368
The Committee sent him directly to us.

97
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,370
There's bound to be something to this.

98
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,107
In the Marduk Report, the matter of the Fifth
Child is also designated as confidential.

99
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,944
So, I did a little hacking into the
Intelligence Department's database.

100
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,913
You’re so reckless!

101
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,373
It was worth it though.

102
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,416
I found out where Miss Ritsuko's being held.

103
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,520
How do you want to go about the
Fifth Child's synch test?

104
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,556
Let's hold off on the trick questions today

105
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,047
and get a straight reading
on what he's capable of.

106
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,661
Fixing graph depth.

107
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,529
Try lowering it another point three.

108
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,380
Yes, Sir.

109
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,234
Are these data readouts accurate?

110
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,237
All instrumentation is operating normally, Sir.

111
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,207
The Magi have not detected
any errors in the data, Sir.

112
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,209
Who would have expected that he would
synchronize with Unit 02

113
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,877
without the core being reconfigured?

114
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,078
This boy...

115
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,180
But this is beyond belief!

116
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,917
This should be impossible, given the system.

117
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,685
Nevertheless, these are the facts.

118
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,616
First, accept the facts for what they are,
and then investigate the why behind them.

119
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:08,256
Central Dogma is currently locked down.
Please use Route 22 as a detour.

120
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,681
You're the First Child, aren't you?

121
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,522
Rei Ayanami...

122
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,460
You're the same as me.

123
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,360
Who are you?

124
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,508
It seems the Fifth Child has
made contact with Rei.

125
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,642
I see.

126
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,144
The Magi are currently pouring
all their resources

127
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,875
into analyzing the data we got
from the Fifth Child.

128
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,866
And yet, we still have no idea what he is.

129
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,484
Who in the world is that boy?

130
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,775
Do not enter without permission.
1'll kill you if you come without asking!

131
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,347
Shiniji still hasn't returned either.

132
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,068
I've failed as a guardian.

133
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,135
Central Dogma is currently open.

134
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,638
Please use Route 3 to transfer.

135
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,599
Hi, were you waiting for me?

136
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,677
No, not really. That's not what I was...

137
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,878
What are you doing today?

138
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,681
Well, the regular tests are over,

139
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,762
so all I have left is to take a shower
and go home, but...

140
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,836
But the truth is, lately, I don't
really want to go home.

141
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,123
A place to return to...

142
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,026
The fact that you have a home
will lead to your happiness.

143
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,260
It's a very good thing.

144
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,495
You think so?

145
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,366
I'd like to talk more with you.

146
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,179
May I come with you?

147
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,448
To take a shower. You still need
to go take one, right?

148
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,372
Is that a no?

149
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,712
Oh, no, that's not what I meant.

150
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,791
You go to such extremes to avoid first contact.

151
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,654
Are you afraid of connecting with other people?

152
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,157
If you don't get close to others,

153
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,292
you'll never be betrayed and
you'll never hurt each other.

154
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,763
But you'll also never be able
to forget your loneliness.

155
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,899
Humans can never banish
their loneliness for good,

156
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,480
because being human means being alone.

157
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,270
But humans are able to go on with their lives

158
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,050
because they're able to forget it every so often.

159
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,214
It's time.

160
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,816
Is it over already?

161
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,018
Yeah, we better go to bed.

162
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:13,869
Together?

163
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,956
Oh, no! I think there's probably
a room ready for you.

164
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,625
A separate one.

165
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:20,706
I see.

166
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,537
Humans constantly feel pain in their hearts.

167
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,366
Because the heart is so sensitive to pain,
humans also feel that to live is to suffer.

168
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,673
You're so delicate, like glass,
especially your heart.

169
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,641
Me?

170
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,372
Yes, you have my regard for it.

171
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,545
Regard?

172
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,746
It means, I love you.

173
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,766
Episode Twenty-Four

174
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,564
The Final
Messenger

175
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:52,791
Nerv, the organization formed to be
Seele's executive branch...

176
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,562
It was created in order to put
our script into practice.

177
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:00,365
But now, it has become an organization
in the possession of one individual.

178
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,402
Precisely, we must take it back.

179
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,237
Before the promised day.

180
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:09,007
Nerv and the Eva series must be
in their true forms.

181
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,488
Ikari, you will bear the responsibility of
your malfeasance towards Seele.

182
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,630
The time that has been given to us runs short.

183
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:21,234
But the Lance of Longinus that stood
in the way of our desire is no more.

184
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,823
Soon, the final Angel will appear.

185
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,059
If we destroy it, our wish will come true.

186
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,810
Just a little longer, Yui.

187
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,744
Why am [ here?

188
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,450
Why am I alive again?

189
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,946
For what?

190
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,335
And for whom?

191
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,155
The Fifth Child... That boy...

192
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,781
I feel as if he's the same as me.

193
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,547
Why?

194
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,156
I'm glad we're on the outskirts of the city,

195
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,117
because it kept you safe from all that.

196
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,295
But there's no guarantee that will be
the case next time.

197
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,565
So, the Horaki family will be taking care
of you starting tomorrow.

198
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,816
This will be goodbye for a while, Pen Pen.

199
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,044
Come on, I'll sleep on the floor.

200
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,045
It's okay.

201
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,414
You're the one who's doing me a favor
by letting me stay over.

202
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,704
I'm fine where I am.

203
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,357
What do you want to talk about?

204
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,030
There are things you want me to hear, right?

205
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,231
All sorts of things have happened
since I came here.

206
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,375
Before coming here, I used
to live with my teacher.

207
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,355
The days were peaceful.
Nothing ever happened.

208
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,801
I only had to exist there.

209
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:51,624
But that was okay, because there
was nothing I had to do.

210
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,780
Did you hate people?

211
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,816
Not really, I think it didn't matter,
one way or another.

212
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,867
But I did hate my father.

213
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,898
Why am I telling Kaworu all this?

214
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,370
Maybe I was born, so that I would meet you.

215
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,612
How did it go? Did you get any data on him?

216
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,435
Here it is.

217
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,770
I borrowed it from First Lieutenant
Ibuki without her permission.

218
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,810
I'm sorry  keep making you do
these theft-like things.

219
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,142
What is this?!

220
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,478
It's no wonder Maya can't release
this information.

221
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,146
It's all theoretically impossible data.

222
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,617
You're right. It only deepens the mystery.

223
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:35,120
To think that he can freely set
his synch rate with the Eva...

224
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,155
And of his own will at that.

225
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,236
I guess this is yet again no time to be
worried about appearances.

226
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,461
I'm surprised you made it in.

227
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,429
There's something I want to ask you.

228
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,598
All conversations in here
are recorded, you know.

229
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,033
I don't care.

230
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,644
Just who is that boy? The Fifth Child?

231
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,945
He is likely the final messenger.

232
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,576
Come on, let's go.

233
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,447
Come with me, Adam's alter ego
and servant of the Lilim.

234
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,254
Eva Unit 02 is activating!

235
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,423
That's impossible! Where's Asuka?

236
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,326
In med room 303! It's been confirmed!

237
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,627
Then who in the world is...

238
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,528
It's unmanned! No entry plug
is present in Unit 02!

239
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,915
There's no one? It's not the Fifth Child?

240
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,204
A developing AT Field has been
detected in Central Dogmal

241
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,005
Is that Unit 027!

242
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,407
No, its pattern is blue!

243
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,008
There's no doubt about it! It's an Angel!

244
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:30,939
What did you say?!

245
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,125
An Angel? That boy?

246
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:39,518
Target has passed through Level 4
and is still descending!

247
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,787
It's no good! We can't cut the power
to the linear carriage!

248
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,522
Target has passed through Level 5!

249
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,892
Emergency lockdown! Close all
partitions in Central Dogmal!

250
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,233
Buy us some time, no matter how little.

251
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,763
Emergency lockdown, all Malebolge
levels being closed.

252
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,634
All personnel, evacuate.
All personnel, evacuate.

253
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,136
I never imagined Seele would
send one directly to us.

254
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,446
The old men intend to step up
the schedule by forcing our hand.

255
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:07,112
The final Angel has entered Central Dogma
and is currently descending.

256
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,347
It's all going according to plan.

257
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,949
Ikari, you were a good friend,

258
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,187
a comrade who shared our aspirations,
and a collaborator who understood.

259
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,122
This is your final task.

260
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,313
I will be praying that it will be
accomplished by Unit O1.

261
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,596
Unit 02 is breaking through
the armored partitions!

262
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,932
Target has passed through Cocytus 2!

263
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,934
Send Eva Unit 01 after it.

264
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:29,768
Yes, Sir.

265
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,579
Stop it from invading Terminal Dogma
at all costs.

266
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,145
But why did the Angel take Unit 02?

267
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,881
Could it be planning to merge with Unit 02?

268
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,417
Or possibly to bring about destruction.

269
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,052
It's a lie! A lie! A lie!

270
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,055
That Kaworu is... He's an Angel?!

271
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,757
That's a lie!

272
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,658
It's a fact. Accept it.

273
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,709
Move out, understood?

274
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,666
Shinji's so late.

275
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,769
Eva Unit 01 heading down Route 2!

276
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,079
In pursuit of target!

277
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,274
You betrayed me! You betrayed my feelings!

278
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,915
You betrayed me, just like Father did!

279
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,846
Unit 01 has reached Level 4.
Coming into contact with the target!

280
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:15,987
There he is!

281
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,217
I've been waiting for you, Shiniji.

282
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,088
Kaworu!

283
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,367
Asuka, sorry!

284
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,229
The Eva series.

285
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,566
Born from Adam, they are an abhorrent
existence for humans.

286
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,569
And the Lilim will even use them
in order to survive.

287
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,770
I can't understand.

288
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,810
Kaworu, stop this! Why?!

289
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,241
The Eva are made of the same body as I am.

290
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,482
Because I am born from Adam as well.

291
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:53,218
I could merge with them,
if only they didn't have souls.

292
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,349
Unit 02's soul has shut itself away for now.

293
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,225
An AT Field!

294
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,562
That's right. That's what you Lilim call it.

295
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,665
The sacred domain where none may trespass.

296
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,467
The light of the soul.

297
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,402
Lilim, you know, don't you?

298
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:14,005
That the AT Field is the wall that
everyone has in their heart?

299
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,876
I don't know anything about that, Kaworu!

300
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,779
Both Eva units have reached the lowest level.

301
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,920
Target distance to Terminal Dogma, 20.

302
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,320
If Unit O1's signal disappears
and another change occurs...

303
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,857
I know. We set this place to self-destruct, right?

304
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,826
It'll be better than letting them
set off the Third Impact.

305
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,261
I'm sorry.

306
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,452
It's okay, as long as I'm with you.

307
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:39,981
Thank you.

308
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,286
The fate of man...

309
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,243
The hope of man is written in sorrow.

310
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:53,745
What's going on?!

311
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,314
It's an AT Field of unprecedented power!

312
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,083
Light, electromagnetic, and particle waves!

313
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,044
It's blocking them all! We can't
monitor anything in there!

314
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,254
We're truly sealed off.

315
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,457
We've lost the target along with
Eva Unit 01 and Unit 02!

316
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,238
We can't contact the pilot!

317
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,125
Kaworu!

318
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,113
Wait!

319
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,557
The final safety has been released!

320
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,548
Heaven's Door is opening!

321
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,757
So, an Angel has finally reached it.

322
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,358
Hyuga...

323
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,338
What's that?!

324
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,172
What's the situation?

325
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,574
It's an AT Field!

326
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,509
The same kind of AT Field that we saw earlier

327
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,111
has developed near the barrier
around Terminal Dogmal!

328
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,380
It's entering the barrier!

329
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,316
It can't be! Another Angel?!

330
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,850
It's no good! We can't confirm that!

331
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,901
Oh, no, it disappeared!

332
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,144
Disappeared?! The Angel did?!

333
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,048
Adam, our mother.

334
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:19,564
Must all who were born of Adam
return to Adam?

335
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,345
Even at the cost of destroying humanity?

336
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,162
No! This is...

337
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,304
Lilith?

338
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,475
I see, so that's what this is about, Lilim.

339
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,356
Thank you, Shiniji.

340
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,547
 wanted you to stop Unit 02.

341
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,829
Otherwise, I may have gone on living with her.

342
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,998
Kaworu, why?

343
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,899
Because it's my destiny to continue to live

344
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,940
even if it may result in the
destruction of humanity.

345
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,706
But I can also die here.

346
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,576
Life and death are of equal value to me.

347
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:08,179
Dying of your own will, that is the one
and only absolute freedom there is.

348
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,260
What?

349
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,318
Kaworu, I don't understand what you're saying!

350
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,139
Kaworu...

351
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,123
My last will and testament.

352
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,438
Now, erase me from this world.

353
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,179
If you don't, you will be
the ones who are erased.

354
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:27,012
Only one life form will be chosen to survive
the time of destruction and be given a future.

355
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,860
And you are not a being who should die.

356
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,929
Your people need the future.

357
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,220
Thank you. I'm glad I met you.

358
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:14,245
Kaworu said that he loved me.

359
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,877
It was...

360
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,158
It was the first time someone
told me they loved me.

361
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,218
He was like me, and like Ayanami.

362
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,451
I loved him.

363
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,040
Kaworu was the one who should have survived.

364
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,241
He was a much better person than I am.

365
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,334
Kaworu should have been the one to survive.

366
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,269
You're wrong.

367
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,990
Only those who have the will to live
get to survive.

368
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,175
He wished to die.

369
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:54,078
He abandoned his will to live,
clinging instead to a false hope.

370
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,688
You did nothing wrong, Shinji.

371
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,420
You're cold, Miss Misato.

372
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,004
