[narrator] <i>At long last,
seven million years of human history</i>

00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,311

00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,649
<i>The apocalypse shall not occur

<i>nor catastrophic asteroid collision.</i>

6
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>But rather, something else.</i>

7
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,704
<i>The extinction of mankind shall be
ushered forth by the will of the gods,</i>

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,248
<i>the very beings

{\an8}THE YOUNGEST OF THE 13 VALKYRIE SISTERS GÖLL

11
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,675
{\an8}Great. It's time now, Brünnhilde.
Looks like everyone's ready.

12
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:57,390
THE COUNCIL OF VALHALLA
COUNCIL HALL

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,393
[gods chattering]

[gavel hammering]

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,398
{\an8}ONE OF THE 12 GODS OF OLYMPUS HERMES

16
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,525
{\an8}[male god clearing throat]
Well then, everybody,

17
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,029
{\an8}it's been some time since
we've all been together, hasn't it?

18
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,032
Let the council of Valhalla now begin.

19
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,077
{\an8}Deities have assembled here
from the world over

20
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,745
{\an8}to decide on the fate of humanity.

21
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,038
{\an8}PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL ZEUS

22
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,540
<i>So, let me ask you...</i>

23
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:28,046
Should we allow mankind to exist
for another 1,000 years

24
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,547
and forgive their crimes?

25
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,548
[ringing]

26
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:35,512
Or alternatively,
do we put an end to them for eternity?

27
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,554
[buzzer sounding]

28
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:40,683
By the will of the gods,
you will show me what you have chosen.

29
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,185
[male god 1] <i>Over here.</i>

30
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,145
Huh?

31
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,814
{\an8}I say we finish off the wretched things.

32
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,315
{\an8}GOD OF DESTRUCTION AND CREATION SHIVA

33
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,775
{\an8}I've watched them for a millennium,

34
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,820
and I haven't caught any sign of them
learning from their mistakes.

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,155
Let's give them
the old fire and brimstone.

36
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,533
[female god] Shiva's right.

37
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,618
Everything is just as he says.

38
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,831
{\an8}As time goes on,
the world becomes uglier and uglier.

39
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,207
{\an8}GODDESS OF BEAUTY APHRODITE

40
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,419
{\an8}<i>The sea fills with trash and oil,
the forests have disappeared,</i>

41
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,131
<i>and countless creatures have gone extinct.</i>

42
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,342
So, if I may, mankind is out of control.

43
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,637
They have become a cancer
that threatens to destroy the earth.

44
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,431
- [all chattering]
- [male god 2] Aphrodite speaks the truth!

45
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,267
[male god 3] We should crush them.

46
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,852
[male god 4] It's unforgivable!

47
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,146
[female god 2] An evil, plain existence.

48
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,857
[male god 5] I'm sick
of trying to guide them.

49
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,650
[male god 6] Here, here.

50
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,029
Now then, it seems the meeting
has reached consensus.

51
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,199
Let the records show
that the Council of Valhalla

52
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,077
has managed to agree
on a unanimous decision

53
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,662
to end the human race!

54
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,205
Just a moment!

55
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,543
[gods muttering]

56
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,170
[male god 7] Who does she think she is?

57
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,838
[all gasping]

58
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,634
{\an8}[male god 7] Did that Valkyrie speak up?

59
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,553
{\an8}THE ELDEST OF THE 13 VALKYRIE SISTERS BRÜNNHILDE

60
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,804
Huh?

61
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,349
[whimpering] What in the world
do you think you're doing, sis?

62
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,394
You can't just raise your voice
against the all-powerful like that!

63
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,396
Pardon my intrusion, your eminences.

64
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,608
But with all due respect, there's
something I'd like to discuss first.

65
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,735
[male voices] Be silent, Brünnhilde!

66
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,153
[screaming]

67
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,907
{\an8}SUPREME NORSE GOD ODIN

68
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,867
{\an8}Bastard, you're nothing
but a common demigod!

69
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,076
HUGINN
MUNINN

70
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,537
{\an8}How dare you loosen your tongue
in the presence of greatness!

71
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,415
You halfling!
Are you asking for a challenge?

72
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,750
[Muninn continues shouting]

73
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,545
{\an8}I will admit, it's true that the sins
of man are indeed unforgivable.

74
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,297
Hey, stop ignoring us!

75
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,757
[Brünnhilde] Despite that fact,

76
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,260
for you to simply wipe them out,
well, it just seems quite dull.

77
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,721
Oh.

78
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,181
Consider this, then.

79
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,724
A proposal.

80
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:49,062
A trial to decide if humans might be
worth keeping alive for years to come.

81
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,690
To demonstrate the power
and the benevolence of all the gods,

82
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,984
why not put humanity to the test?

83
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,236
What's your plan?

84
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,696
To flood the earth
into one big ocean again?

85
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:02,367
Or are you thinking about
starting another ice age to freeze them?

86
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,993
Neither.

87
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,871
Because I've come up with
a far more effective method.

88
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,248
- Hmm...
- [gods chattering]

89
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,459
- [male god 8] What could she be planning?
- [male god 9] Tell us your plan, then.

90
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,544
[male god 10] Halfling bastard.

91
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,217
I propose the ultimate trial
between the gods and mankind...

92
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,052
the Ragnarok!

93
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,515
No!

94
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,849
You can't be serious.

95
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:35,817
It's a special provision from article 62,
clause 15 of the constitution.

96
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,902
It stipulates the following.

97
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,656
"A final battle between the beast
and his creator."

98
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,658
"A one-on-one showdown."

99
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,955
<i>[narrator] Behold,
the God versus Man Final Battle Law,</i>

100
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,416
<i>known as the "Ragnarok."</i>

101
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:57,046
<i>It is a series of duels
between 13 fighters representing the gods,</i>

102
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,965
<i>and the human race.</i>

103
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,718
<i>First side to seven matches wins.</i>

104
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,013
<i>If humanity loses,
it would face destruction.</i>

105
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,890
<i>Of course, should man reign victorious,</i>

106
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,228
<i>the gods must let them live
for another thousand years.</i>

107
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:18,192
<i>However, this law has never been exercised
in the entire history of civilization.</i>

108
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,946
<i>Their reasoning,
that man would never prevail.</i>

109
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,448
THE REASONING

110
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,158
Their success would be impossible.

111
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,200
IMPOSSIBLE

112
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,704
<i>In other words,
it's an extra-judicial clause.</i>

113
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:34,959
<i>A superfluous technicality
enacted purely for divine amusement.</i>

114
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,673
[gods laughing]

115
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:42,842
[Huginn] Ha!

116
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,136
What are you blabbering about?

117
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,848
Surely even a Valkyrie
can comprehend the ridiculousness of that.

118
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,476
Man is nothing in the face of godly power!

119
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,728
[both] What a pointless idea.

120
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,229
[male god 11] I agree.

121
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,939
[male god 12] It's barely even...

122
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,400
[shouting continues]

123
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,780
I see.

124
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,326
So, the gods have decided to obliterate
the human race and be done with it.

125
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,327
To be clear...

126
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,831
you're trying to avoid a direct
confrontation with them.

127
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,625
Would you say that's correct?

128
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,834
- Hm?
- Huh?

129
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,671
You'd prefer to destroy them
without having to fight them yourselves.

130
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,466
Sounds like you'd rather
not be put in the same ring.

131
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:27,345
And if that's true... No, don't tell me...

132
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,972
I might be wrong, but that means...

133
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,601
you're all completely
terrified aren't you?

134
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:38,981
[echoing]

135
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,984
- [Göll whimpering]
- [Brünnhilde sighing]

136
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,278
If that's the case, then 1,000 apologies

137
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,614
for my careless outburst,
your greatnesses.

138
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,741
[stammering] Uh,
that's a joke, right, sis?

139
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,495
Silly me. Feel free
to disregard everything I just said.

140
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,624
Let's forget about that Ragnarok nonsense
and get back to it.

141
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,877
[whimpering] Hey, enough kidding around.

142
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,712
Forget about them wiping out mankind,

143
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,881
'cause at this rate
they're gonna wipe you out first.

144
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,259
Just hurry up
and apologize to them for real.

145
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,678
Say you're sorry,
and they might show us mercy!

146
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,514
[gods laughing]

147
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,601
Huh? What's so funny?

148
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,937
Shouldn't they be mad at us?
They're all laughing.

149
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,941
[rumbling]

150
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,693
Ah!

151
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,705
[narrator] <i>Of course,
Brünnhilde knew what she was doing.</i>

152
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,373
[Göll screaming]

153
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,837
[Brünnhilde] <i>Just as I thought. The gods
have much shorter tempers than humans do.</i>

154
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,717
[Zeus laughing]

155
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,136
What a fascinating idea!

156
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,180
A proper Ragnarok.

157
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,016
I must admit,
I'm quite pleased you brought it up.

158
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,520
Why, I could almost begin
to picture it in my head.

159
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,231
Surely I'm not alone here?

160
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:06,277
Please, the rest of you
are intrigued as well, no?

161
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,197
The mighty wrath of the gods,

162
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,657
overwhelming power,

163
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,411
a gratuitous display
of strength and authority.

164
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,664
How very exciting, isn't it?

165
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,042
Tell me, everyone, what do you think?

166
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:25,087
Let's have a brawl between man and maker!

167
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,925
A death match unlike any
the world has ever seen!

168
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,346
[gavel hammering]

169
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:44,649
[raucously cheering]

170
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,860
[both cawing]

171
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:52,114
[narrator] <i>And thus,
the supreme joust between the eternal</i>

172
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,617
<i>and ephemeral was set in motion.</i>

173
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,369
GOD VS. MAN - FINAL BATTLE RAGNAROK

174
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,871
Hear that, Brünnhilde?

175
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,752
The humans need a vanguard
to represent them.

176
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,381
I'll permit you to choose candidates
on their behalf.

177
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,509
You do want to assist them, don't you?

178
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,555
A curious inclination
for a tragic Valkyrie like you.

179
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,183
A half-god, half-human,
who hopes to save mankind

180
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,186
despite having once
been slain by them, right?

181
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,654
There's over seven million years
of human history.

182
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,157
I will select the 13 most worthy
of this particular challenge.

183
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,410
[Zeus chuckling]

184
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,746
- [Zeus laughing hysterically]
- [Göll sighing]

185
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,968
RAGNAROK

186
00:09:56,137 --> 00:10:00,141
[fanfare playing]

187
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,603
VALHALLA ARENA

188
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,939
[crowd cheering]

189
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,755
[Göll] Whoa, looks like
they're almost ready.

190
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,214
So it'll start soon then?

191
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,716
Yes.

192
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,301
There are so many gods here.

193
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,720
I wonder which of them
they're going to send out first.

194
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,605
{\an8}At long last.
I've been waiting for this for ages.

195
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,023
{\an8}THE GUARDIAN OF THE END HEIMDALL

196
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,193
{\an8}[speaking excitedly] The moment
I finally get to blow the Gjallarhorn!

197
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,196
It's time to raise the curtain
for the main event!

198
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,115
That's right,
the wildly anticipated Ragnarok!

199
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,994
[yelling] Let's get loud, everyone.
Are you ready?

200
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,664
[crowd cheering wildly]

201
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,541
The rules are straightforward.

202
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,337
It's a fight to the death,
whether they're human or a god.

203
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,800
The victor shall be decided the moment
that one party annihilates the other.

204
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,470
Our first round begins.

205
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,431
Introducing god number one,

206
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,726
the legend himself,

207
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,607
Everybody knows who this is.

208
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,069
His trusty Mjölnir can crush the earth!

209
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,780
And if he can't do it, no one can,

210
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,076
because he lives for battle
and dies for battle.

211
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,038
[crackling]

212
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,131
The strength of the Norse.

213
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:59,885
{\an8}The one and only, Thor!

214
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,888
[crowd cheering]

215
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,643
[whimpering] They're really
starting off with the god of thunder?

216
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,730
No. There's no way we can win
against that monster, is there?

217
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,774
I have faith in our warrior, Göll.

218
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,110
Don't worry. He's got this.

219
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,027
[gasping]

220
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,030
{\an8}Of the men I've encountered
on the battlefield,

221
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,407
{\an8}he's the boldest.

222
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,075
STRONGEST

223
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,160
EVILEST

224
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,537
No, the most savage
and deranged beast that I have ever met.

225
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,789
CRAZIEST

226
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,916
Moving on.

227
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,336
Here's the guy
who's representing the humans today.

228
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,548
First up for the idiots, here he is!

229
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,054
[gong sounding]

230
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,057
[yelling]

231
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,772
What was that?
Is this where your legacy ends?

232
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,232
[all] No!

233
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:59,445
Seven million years of history,
is this where you yield your pride?

234
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,905
[all] No!

235
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,619
[horse whinnying]

236
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,291
[gasping] Whoa.

237
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,801
Oh dear.

238
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:27,640
[Heimdall] That's right. He's determined
to carry the torch for mankind.

239
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,308
There's no one else like him.

240
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,768
He's a brute!

241
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,479
He's ravenous enough to devour the gods.

242
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,524
Is there anybody more bloodthirsty?

243
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,900
[all] No!

244
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:42,530
[Heimdall] He's one of the most
vicious barbarians since the dawn of time.

245
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,906
Any objections?

246
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,241
[all] No!

247
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,748
[Heimdall] He's the champion of China!

248
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,125
The flying general,

249
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,628
Lü Bu!

250
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,047
[crowd cheering]

251
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,425
My liege...

252
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,102
Hail, Amitabha Buddha.

253
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,896
- [Brünnhilde] Enough. Stop praying, human.
- Hail, Amitabha Buddha.

254
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,648
Huh? Huh?

255
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,944
There's something you should realize
about the deities you're praying to.

256
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,074
They're the same ones we have to defeat.

257
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,493
Your prayers, they're for the enemy.

258
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,121
[Heimdall] We're off!

259
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,331
It's a dispute of destiny.

260
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,751
The last stand-off between god and man,
the Ragnarok!

261
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,380
We've got a hard pair
of heavy-hitters for our first match-up!

262
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,174
Representing the gods,

263
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:49,263
here comes the Nordic force,
the berserker of thunder himself...

264
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:53,100
Give it up for Thor!

265
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,771
[crowd cheering wildly]

266
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,066
And his opponent from the human side...

267
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,826
The toughest hero from the records
of Three Kingdoms...

268
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:17,416
Let's get loud for Lü Bu!

269
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,925
[cheering wildly]

270
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,887
It truly is
the strongest versus the strongest!

271
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,933
The energy in the arena
is fully off the charts!

272
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,309
{\an8}You can do it, Thor!

273
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,268
{\an8}GOD OF PEACE FORSETI

274
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,020
{\an8}The other guy's only a measly human.

275
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,522
{\an8}Come on,
you can knock him out in a single blow!

276
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,775
- [man] Strike them down, Lü Bu!
- Huh?

277
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,902
What the heck are you waiting for?

278
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,781
Go and tear those sons of bitches
into mincemeat! [laughing]

279
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,158
Huh? That's awfully vulgar.

280
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,995
- [glugging]
- [creaking]

281
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,205
Hm?

282
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:01,293
{\an8}Ah, nothing better than a high stakes
battle royale to help the drinks go down.

283
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,670
{\an8}ZHANG FEI

284
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,213
{\an8}Am I right, or am I right?

285
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,091
{\an8}Hm, I don't understand.

286
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,301
{\an8}Since when was he the toughest
hero from the records?

287
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,219
{\an8}LIU BEI

288
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,514
Shouldn't that refer to the being
who was actually deified?

289
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,600
And wouldn't that be you,
the great Guan Yu?

290
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,145
[Guan Yu] If we're only
considering tactical prowess,

291
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,106
then I concede that point.

292
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,025
{\an8}On the other hand,
the answer might be different

293
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,737
{\an8}if one were measuring strength
by one's pure ability as a warrior.

294
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,492
{\an8}Which would make the toughest man
in the Three Kingdoms,

295
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,577
none other than Lü Bu!

296
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,747
[Zhang Fei] Ha! Ain't that right!

297
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:44,628
{\an8}That being said, when it comes
to his army, things never change, do they?

298
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,173
[cheering and clanging]

299
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,511
[cheering stops]

300
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,763
{\an8}[Chen Gong] <i>My liege,
all your men are here.</i>

301
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,223
{\an8}ADVISOR IN LÜ BU'S ARMY
CHEN GONG

302
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,391
{\an8}<i>Let us watch over you.</i>

303
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01,020
{\an8}<i>Whenever you are on the battlefield,
we shall be right there beside you.</i>

304
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,190
[voice breaking] <i>Such glory.
I never imagined it, sir,</i>

305
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,528
<i>the day I'd get to gaze upon
your gallant figure once again.</i>

306
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,865
<i>It's indescribable.</i>

307
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,660
[Göll] Lü Bu may be strong,

308
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,705
but Brünnhilde,
do you think that he can win?

309
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,958
It seems you doubt
that humanity stands a chance.

310
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,294
Is that what you honestly
choose to believe?

311
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,921
[stammering] Ah, I don't know.

312
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:32,259
[laughing] I'm certain every god gathered
here today believes the same thing.

313
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,094
Every single one of them.

314
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,305
That's why man has a chance.

315
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,641
The gods have fucked with
the human race for far too long.

316
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,227
Now's the best time for them
to kick their asses.

317
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,564
Uh, you did not just say "fuck."

318
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,691
[Brünnhilde] I said what I said.

319
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,861
- So we're kicking their asses?
- That's right, sister.

320
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,529
Jeez.

321
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,033
You know, you have
a filthy mouth sometimes, sis.

322
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,622
[Heimdall] <i>Here we go.</i>

323
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,583
<i>Do you know how long
I've yearned for this?</i>

324
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,545
<i>I finally get to play
that wonderful sound.</i>

325
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,470
[narrator] <i>According to the Edda
of Norse mythology,</i>

326
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,181
<i>when Heimdall, the guardian of the end,</i>

00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,435

328
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,773

00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,568

00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,571
{\an8}May they be extinguished.

[cawing]

332
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,035
I'm not sure what I imagined,
but it's starting.

333
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,832
{\an8}The battle between gods and mankind.

334
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:51,547
[horn sounding tunefully]

335
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,762
THE FINAL BATTLE BETWEEN GOD AND MAN
ROUND ONE

336
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,764
THOR VS. LÜ BU

337
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:04,268
THE BATTLE BEGINS!

338
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,147
[gasping for air]

339
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,444
Now then, the mightiest
of the gods is primed,

340
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,905
and the mightiest of men is ready!

341
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,701
Without further ado,
may the first round commence!

342
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,494
{\an8}- Huh?
- What are they doing?

343
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,412
Why aren't they...

344
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,414
[crowd murmuring]

345
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,542
[Heimdall] Look at that.
They've lowered their weapons!

346
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,295
And they're... They're defenseless!

347
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,256
It seems like they're about
to approach each other.

348
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,014
How unpredictable!

349
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,682
And we've only begun.

350
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,476
Both fighters have left
their guards completely open.

351
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:50,147
Yet it appears they're starting to close
in on the distance between them!

352
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:54,568
Huh. Neither looks interested in
their enemy's next move.

353
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,155
As if they don't care about
taking advantage of any strategies.

354
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,158
I had a feeling things might go this way.

355
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,829
[laughing] He may be an odd one,
but that's our guy!

356
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,039
Hm.

357
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,124
Who does that lowly ant think he is?

358
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,544
That insolent mortal
ought to be cowering in fear!

359
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:19,551
[all chanting]

360
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,802
[crying]

361
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,598
[chanting continues]

362
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,808
[Chen Gong] <i>Breathe, my liege.</i>

363
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:31,813
[chanting continues]

364
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,153
Brünnhilde,

365
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,907
the guy who's defending humanity's honor
does know what he's doing, right?

366
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,659
'Cause the impression that I'm getting

367
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,078
is he's kind of underestimating
what he's up against.

368
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,207
[Brünnhilde] <i>That's how
the so-called strongest live their lives.</i>

369
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,597
[narrator] <i>Thor and Lü Bu.</i>

370
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,976
<i>Although these two come from
different lineage,</i>

371
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,436
<i>they share one thing in common.</i>

372
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:16,316
<i>A penchant for slaughtering
their foes in one fell swoop.</i>

373
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,612
[grunting]

374
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,577
[growling]

375
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,043
Huh?

376
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,341
[straining]

377
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,379
[heavy metal music playing]
