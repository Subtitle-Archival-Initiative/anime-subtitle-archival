Lü Bu, what a man!

16
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,615
He took Thor's attack
and blocked it with ease.

17
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,204
That's my liege!

18
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,207
[yelling]

19
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,376
Huh.

20
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,421
What is this nonsense?

21
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,007
Wasn't that the move
that defeated Jörmungandr!?

22
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,969
What insolence!
That human, who does he think he is?

25
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,974
I beg of you,

26
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,811
please, don't push my sister Griz
too hard out there!

27
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,274
I want you to be careful with her, okay?

28
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,984
Huh?

00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,994
Hm?

33
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,496
What's this?

34
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,413
Hm.

Oh my gods!

41
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,270
Thor's attack has shattered Lü Bu's leg!

42
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:35,024
This might just be the end of the line
for Lü Bu in this bout.

43
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,407
- [cracking]
- [grunting painfully]

[Guan Yu] Oh.

46
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,344

- Hermes?
- Yes?

50
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,563
I've decided high stakes fights like these
are most agreeable.

51
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,480
Quite.

52
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,232
My what a show.

53
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,485
Lü Bu trying to block
Thor's attack straight on.

54
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,530
That certainly was enjoyable.

55
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,993
However, his body won't be able
to withstand much more.

56
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,077
Hm.

57
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,747
This is over.

58
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,377
[tense music playing]

59
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,682
Ah! No, my liege.

60
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,311
Defeated again, before my very eyes.

61
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,979
Such cruel fate.

62
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,190
Look at all that blood!

63
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,692
Brünnhilde, what the heck are we gonna do?

64
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,571
Run away! Hey, Lü Bu!
Get out of there now!

65
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,575
- [hooves beating]
- [gasping]

66
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,332
{\an8}Look, Göll. It seems we may have
an ace in the hole after all, you see?

67
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,459
- Huh?
- [horse whinnying]

68
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,461
That sound is...

69
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,546
[hooves beating]

70
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,466
[whinnying loudly]

71
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,346
- Huh?
- Lü Bu steed, the Red Hare!

72
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,812
There's a horse?
Where'd that thing come from?

73
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,397
This is madness.

74
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,065
Oh, how exciting.

75
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,526
And what a manly steed it is too.

76
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,405
The Red Hare? How's it here?

77
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,741
It must be... a miracle.

78
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,634
[snorting]

79
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,970
My old friend.

80
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,018
Right. I see now.

81
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,062
He hasn't given up.

82
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,940
And neither can we!

83
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,483
Until the end!

84
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,568
Oh!

85
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,445
We must believe in our leader
not matter what!

86
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,412
[soldiers yelling]

87
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,333
We pledge our lives to the Flying General,

88
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,044
our lord and liege, Lü Bu!

89
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,504
[all] Hail!

90
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,839
Hail!

91
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,091
Hail, Lü Bu!

92
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:51,095
{\an8}Come on! Is sitting down there
on your knees your idea of a joke?

93
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,099
Well, it's not funny.
You're the strongest man in the world.

94
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,184
Get up!

95
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,105
Yes, he's right. We know you can do it.

96
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,609
[humans screaming encouragement]

97
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,818
Fight on?

98
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,278
That's what they want?

99
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,822
Wow, humans really can be so cruel.

100
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,783
What a reckless man.

101
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,203
I think that I like it.

102
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,121
I really hope he doesn't quit.

103
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,125
[Heimdall] <i>There's no way he can get up.</i>

104
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,753
<i>I mean, do I want to see him try?</i>

105
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,755
<i>It'd be funny for sure.</i>

106
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,299
<i>But that's impossible. This fight is over.</i>

107
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,135
<i>They can't really
expect anything different.</i>

108
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,221
<i>- I might as well call it--</i>
- [crowd exclaiming]

109
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,890
Huh? What's going on?

110
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,606
Lü Bu!

111
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,899
{\an8}Go!

Lü Bu! Lü Bu!

114
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,533
What? No way.

120
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,475
[breathing deeply]

121
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,436
[Heimdall] He got up!

122
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,941
[humans cheering]

123
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,151
Yay!

124
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,864
Go!

125
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,284
[whinnying]

126
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:40,538
It would seem that Lü Bu refuses to quit!

127
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,002
Hmm.

128
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,045
[laughing]

129
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:54,927
Hell, yeah! Now there's a sight.
Lü Bu on the Red Hare again.

130
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:59,265
You used to ride the Red Hare
once upon a time too. What do you think?

131
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,059
Ha. They belong together.

132
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,355
The Red Hare is truly Lü Bu's steed.

133
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,441
[crowd cheering]

134
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,410
[fire crackling]

[Lü Bu] <i>When I was but a child,</i>

136
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:30,838
<i>I watched a giant tree
be reduced to ash by a bolt of lightning.</i>

137
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,842
<i>I didn't fear the dancing flames.</i>

138
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,556
<i>I could only think of one thing...</i>

139
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,101
<i>Of heaven...</i>

140
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,064
<i>and the gods who lived there.</i>

141
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,819
Up there are the strongest beings.

142
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,113

00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,055
Fight on!

147
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,600
Lord Zeus, you're going
to allow this to happen?

148
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,310
It's against the rules, is it not?

149
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,438
Don't spoil the fun, Hermes.

150
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,065
Besides, look.

151
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:37,071
It may be a one-on-one fight,
but that horse is a part of him now.

152
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,657
[both giggling]

153
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,410
[Hermes] Hm.

My old friend.

156
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,669
This could be it.

157
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,505
I want to ask
if you'll entrust your life to me.

- Yes, my liege.
- [soldiers cheering]

161
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,233
All right! That's the spirit!

162
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,159
[Heimdall] Lü Bu is
finally back in the fight.

163
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:28,664
The Red Hare has become his legs,
and now he's running circles around Thor.

164
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,542
But Thor is not moving.

165
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,837
What's Lü Bu's plan?

166
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,055
Ah, that move! He changed his grip.

167
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,017
Holding his halberd in that manner
can only mean one thing!

168
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,770
His secret technique!

169
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,064
[Lü Bu counting] 36,863...

00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,649
[Brünnhilde] <i>That fateful spring,</i>

00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,895
My liege...

185
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:20,442
<i>He spent years doing nothing
but training in solitude.</i>

186
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,612
<i>And then...</i>

[straining]

188
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,788

<i>...split the sky in two.</i>

191
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,183
<i>The superhuman strength
of Lü Bu's grip and swing</i>

192
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,770
<i>gave a tremendous amount
of momentum to his halberd.</i>

193
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,607
<i>And that is how
his secret technique was born.</i>

194
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,339
<i>Despite his achievement,</i>

195
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,426
<i>he was haunted by the fact that the attack
would never be used on another.</i>

196
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,391
<i>Still, he gave
that lonely technique a name,</i>

197
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,809
<i>Sky Eater.</i>

198
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,815
<i>I've waited thousands of years
to see this.</i>

199
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,820
<i>Finally, my liege
can unleash his strongest attack,</i>

200
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:52,326
<i>using his strongest weapon,
mounted atop his mighty steed,</i>

201
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,329
<i>facing off against his strongest opponent.</i>

202
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:00,334
<i>A worthy foe.
One he'd gladly call his comrade!</i>

[roaring]

204
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,756

- You mortals are an intriguing bunch.

206

[narrator] <i>Lü Bu could feel it.</i>

<i>He knew that the technique
he was about to unleash,</i>

212
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,829
<i>would be the most powerful attack
he ever performed in his life.</i>

How 'bout that?

261
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,912
I was worried about
how it was going to turn out.
