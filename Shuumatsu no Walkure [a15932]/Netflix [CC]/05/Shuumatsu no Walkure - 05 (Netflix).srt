00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,015
[slashing]

2
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,814
[crackling]

3
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,577
[roaring]

4
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:39,039
[growling]

5
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:01,478
[Heimdall] Ragnarok round one
has ended with Thor as its victor.

6
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:06,441
The human race is one step closer
to its inevitable end!

7
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,456
[heavy metal music playing]

8
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,582
[sorrowful music playing]

9
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,837
[chuckles] He went out with a smile.

10
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,964
That's Lü Bu for you.

11
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,173
[sniffling]

12
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,550
Indeed.

13
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,927
He couldn't have died
a more fitting death.

14
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,972
[grunting]

15
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,349
Let's pour one out for him.

16
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:06,853
Hm.

17
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,903
A toast to our comrade.

18
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,533
Here's to the honorable, Lü Bu.
The great Flying General.

19
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,544
[sighing] Hm.

20
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,382
[male god 1] Did you genuinely think
your champion stood a chance?

21
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,551
Think again, you foolish mortals.

22
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,845
[male god 2] The power of the gods!

23
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,347
[male god 3] Bow down!

24
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,807
Offer sacrifice!

25
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,019
Ho! Yes! Are you starting
to get it, humans?

26
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,147
You can try all you like,
but you can't defeat Thor!

27
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,779
[voice breaking] Why do the gods
sound so pleased amongst themselves?

28
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,238
They're like children.

29
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,408
Aren't they supposed to be
the ones in charge here?

30
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,376
Hey, where are you going?

31
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,679
Right then. Come along.
The exit is this way, Master Thor.

32
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,478
Huh?

33
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,106
<i>He won, didn't he?</i>

34
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,651
<i>What reason could he possibly have
to look so annoyed?</i>

35
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,403
[whinnying]

36
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,243
[snuffling]

37
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,039
[snorting and whinnying]

38
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,333
Yes, me too, Red Hare.

39
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,212
Now that my liege
has fought his last battle and perished,

40
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,506
what meaning is there in living anymore?

41
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,216
None.

42
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,097
Everyone, may we all perish with him.

43
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,598
[all yelling]

44
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,308
Huh? Wait...

45
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,854
Let us follow after our beloved general!

46
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,772
[yelling]

47
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,691
[whinnying]

48
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,864
[all yelling]

49
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,365
Stop at once!

50
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,160
The round is over already. You lost.

51
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,787
I said that's enough, so knock it off.

52
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,831
- Very well.
- Huh?

53
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,085
I guess this one's for him.

54
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,337
[crackling]

55
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,344
[exclaiming fearfully]

56
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,220
You asked for it.

57
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,599
So here's a farewell present
for your dear liege.

58
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,191
A glorious honor! May the name
of our lord echo in the thunder!

59
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,276
[all yelling]

60
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,037
Whoa, what was that sound just now?

61
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,455
[rumbling]

62
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,583
Wait, Brünnhilde.

63
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,543
Slow down a bit, will you?

64
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,380
Uh... Hey...

65
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,592
Do... Do we know
what'll happen with Lü Bu and Randgriz?

66
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,595
They took a real beating. What's next?

67
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,056
What do you mean, "next"?

68
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,767
That's a foolish question.

69
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,397
[wind whistling]

70
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,084
[shattering]

71
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,779
[Brünnhilde] <i>This was
a battle of souls, Göll.</i>

72
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:35,079
Once a soul is shattered,
there is no way to repair it.

73
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,249
It won't come back to life or be reborn.

74
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,210
One is simply reduced to dust,
floating in the universe.

75
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,588
Huh? Floating where?

76
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,381
Niflheimr.

77
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,926
In other words,
the soul completely disappears.

78
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,180
There's no afterlife.

79
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,556
So there is no next.

80
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:00,396
If you would be so kind, then go ahead
and offer yourself, Randgriz.

81
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,357
As you wish, sister.

82
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,525
My pleasure.

83
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,361
[whimpering]

84
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,364
Why? That's awful.

85
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,493
How can you say that
as if it's no big deal?

86
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,828
We'll never be able
to see our sister again!

87
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,750
Why? Are you gonna pretend
you won't miss Randgriz's beautiful smile?

88
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,503
Are you even remotely sad that
we basically watched her funeral?

89
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,714
Am I sad?

90
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,426
You think we can beat the gods
by crying our eyes out?

91
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,725
Look, do we really have to go this far?

92
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,853
[sobbing] Just to win
this stupid challenge?

93
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,321
There is much at stake.

94
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,658
The fate of all humanity
rests on our shoulders.

95
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,453
[sobbing loudly]

96
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,850
The first round is now over.

97
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,563
Instead of dwelling on the past,
we must prepare for the future.

98
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,274
Our next order of business,

99
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,110
is to select our representative
for round two.

100
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,487
I don't know.

101
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,282
Lü Bu was the toughest hero.

102
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,577
And despite the odds,
he still couldn't defeat Thor in the end.

103
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,579
[dejectedly] So who else even could?

104
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,999
[beeping]

105
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,921
Excellent question.

106
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,466
For our next battle,
why don't we send out this fellow?

107
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,926
Huh?

108
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:59,181
He's a human who despises the gods
more than anybody else.

109
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,892
Let's bet on the man
with the strongest will.

110
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,732
[gasping]

111
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,443
{\an8}Isn't that file number...

112
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,194
one?

113
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,203
[crowd cheering]

114
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,003
We're back.

115
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:33,341
You may recall the gruesome state
of the ring at the end of round one.

116
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,261
But thanks to divine intervention
it has been restored!

117
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,597
Is everyone ready?

118
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,225
Because it's about time for round two!

119
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,518
[gods cheering]

120
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,646
Those weak meatsacks
don't stand a chance against us.

121
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:51,233
{\an8}We'll make this pathetic fool
go down as easy as the last.

122
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,361
[humans shouting angrily]

123
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,239
{\an8}We're all counting on you!

124
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,617
Next up for the humans,

125
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,328
representing the hope of mankind,

126
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,705
may he carry it through the entire match!

127
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,167
And here he comes!

128
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,418
[rumbling]

129
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,629
[rock music playing]

130
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,527
[gods exclaiming]

131
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,536
[humans exclaiming]

132
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,964
[overlapping animal sounds]

133
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:59,301
Huh? Who in the world
could have predicted such an entrance?

134
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,595
"Rule over the fish in the sea,

135
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,180
the birds in the sky,

136
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,559
and over every living creature
that moves on the ground!"

137
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,519
That's right.

138
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,149
Thus did god bless our challenger,
making him in his own image.

139
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,527
To think the day would come

140
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,571
that this man would rebel,

141
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,991
and stand up against his creator!

142
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,634
- [humans gasping]
- But there's no possible way!

143
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,845
Oh my goodness, it's actually him!

144
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,064
[Heimdall] In other words,

145
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,942
you could say he's a man among men.

146
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,737
Talk about a man's man!

147
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,950
The only thing he holds
is in the weight of his fists!

148
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,954
A keen disciple of raw, unarmed combat!

149
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,377
The originator of original sin!

150
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:22,092
In the whole of history, no one
despises the gods more than this guy!

151
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,596
If there's anyone who deserves
to sock it to 'em,

152
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,600
there's no debate, it has to be him.

153
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,102
He's the father of humanity.

154
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,896
Introducing...

155
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,566
[shouting] Adam!

156
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,993
{\an8}MICHELANGELO

157
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,079
{\an8}Ah, a beautiful work of artistry.

158
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,919
Sour.

159
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:03,634
[angelic choir music playing]

160
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:17,356
MANKIND FILE

161
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,240
- Could it be? The first mortal?
- What nonsense!

162
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,577
{\an8}How's a puny thing like him
supposed to take on a deity?

163
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,246
The boy's a total shrimp
compared to the last guy.

164
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,749
I must say, I disagree.

165
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,710
I think he's rather dashing.

166
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:44,049
Oh my! What an unexpected
turn of events we have.

167
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,177
Even the gods are making a commotion
over his appearance.

168
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,389
See that, folks?
That's what you call star-power!

169
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,101
On that note,
who might be facing off against him?

170
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,729
Man's progenitor is no slouch.

171
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:01,483
Well, we had the strongest of the Norse
gods representing us in round one.

172
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,361
This time it's the deadliest
of Hindu Devas!

173
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,113
Let's check him out!

174
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,122
What the...

175
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,375
- [tinkling]
- Huh?

176
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,379
What's with the sudden hold up?

177
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,006
[Brünnhilde] Hm?

178
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,425
What's that? A last minute change?

179
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,593
So who's next?

180
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,511
Wait, say that again.

181
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,473
[stammering] You're kidding!

182
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,101
[sorrowful string music playing]

183
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,986
That music piece sounds familiar.

184
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,364
{\an8}I know this song. Master Bach composed it.

185
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,823
{\an8}W. A. MOZART
CHILD PRODIGY

186
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:54,036
{\an8}A partial arrangement named "Air on
the G String" from my orchestral suite!

187
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,496
{\an8}However,

188
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,290
{\an8}in all my years of writing
chorales and cantatas,

189
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,001
{\an8}I've never heard
a more heart-rending performance.

190
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:05,005
My stars, what a heavenly rendition!

191
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,810
Huh? That's Master Hermes, though.

192
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,938
Hold on. Is he actually
going to be the next opponent?

193
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,441
But he... He wasn't on the list,
so there has to be some mistake, right?

194
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,402
{\an8}There's no way!

195
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,195
[clearing throat]

196
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:32,282
Apologies for
the technical difficulties, folks.

197
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,867
Moving along.

198
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,746
I shall finish introducing
our fighters for round two!

199
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,915
In this corner, there's Adam,

200
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,793
you know, the man-among-men man.

201
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,503
And up against him is...

202
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,922
this gentlegod!

203
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,507
[stammering] Actually...

204
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,719
it's the one standing behind him!

205
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,723
Why hello there, everybody!

206
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,224
Ah!

207
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,102
So please be gentle!

208
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,688
[screaming]

209
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:07,192
[groaning] <i>Not that creepy old fart!</i>

210
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,236
{\an8}- [gods clamoring]
- Is this really happening?

211
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,947
{\an8}Master Zeus is
the contender for round two?

212
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,367
Seriously? What's that
grandfather doing up there?

213
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,286
Is he also a god?

214
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,329
Can he throw a punch without keeling over?

215
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,914
Oh!

216
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,916
Ha!

217
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,294
Ho!

218
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,254
[snapping]

219
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,214
Come on, maestro!

220
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,092
Hit it!

221
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,303
Hmm.

222
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,846
My goodness.

223
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,015
Let's hope I haven't gotten too rusty.

224
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,100
[music stops]

225
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,317
It's been several millennia
since I've played that tune.

226
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,742
I shall herald you to battle.

227
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,745
SLAYER ON THE G-STRING!

228
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,164
- [hard rock string music playing]
- [chuckling]

229
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,168
Wait, this melody. Could it be?

230
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,214
Why, it's "Slayer on the G-string"!

231
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,762
- Amazing!
- A celestial performance fit for a god!

232
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:21,517
What can I say,
this song always gets me pumped.

233
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,643
Oh yeah!

234
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,979
[Heimdall] Adam was
the first man to walk the Earth,

235
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,732
which makes him the father of mankind.

236
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,236
Therefore, Zeus being Zeus makes him,

237
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,322
the father of the gods!

238
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:40,035
Of rather, he's the GFOC!

239
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,497
Godfather of the Cosmos!

240
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:47,000
The holy patriarch of the entire universe!

241
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,129
[gods chanting] GFOC! GFOC!

242
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,178
- [GFOC chant continues]
- [Zeus laughing]

243
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,688
- [crowd cheering wildly]
- [GFOC chant continues]

244
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,357
[Zeus groaning]

245
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,778
[chuckling]

246
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,286
[chanting continues]

247
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,608
Do you have any idea
what it is we're looking at, Brünnhilde?

248
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,860
Why are they acting so excited?

249
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,236
Haven't got a clue.

250
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,488
What are those creepy gyrations?

251
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,116
- So weird.
- Who does that old geezer think he is?

252
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,119
[Heimdall] The gift
of creation is at his whim.

253
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,831
Whatever displeases him
is sent back to the void!

254
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:12,211
A timeless tyrant, and absolute Olympian!

255
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,838
[chanting continues]

256
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:20,802
Eons ago, he waged a war
with the mightiest beings in the universe.

257
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,638
The clash of the titans!

258
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:28,101
In the end, he overthrew his own father,
killing Cronus himself.

259
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,896
- Yeah.
- He is the biggest battle buff ever!

260
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,024
Truly the infinite among infinites,

261
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,692
a real god of gods!

262
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,570
Give it up for...

263
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,616
Z... Z... Zeus!

264
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,703
Z... Z... Zeus!

265
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,124
Z... Z... Zeus!

266
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,962
Oh yeah!

267
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,090
ZEUS

268
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,593
[gods cheering]

269
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,350
No, it's the ruler of the gods!

270
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,560
Wha... What's happening here?

271
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,604
Aren't we in enough trouble already?

272
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,274
I... I... I know he's strong,

273
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,527
but why's the final boss starting now
instead of during the last round?

274
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,948
I don't know. But I didn't think
that he'd show up this early.

275
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,991
[fireworks launching]

276
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,757
[laughing] Oh yeah!

277
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,136
[gods cheering]

278
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,473
[laughing]

279
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,651
<i>I thought I was prepared, but...</i>

280
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,071
<i>I never expected this.</i>

281
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,285
[Japanese pop ballad playing]
