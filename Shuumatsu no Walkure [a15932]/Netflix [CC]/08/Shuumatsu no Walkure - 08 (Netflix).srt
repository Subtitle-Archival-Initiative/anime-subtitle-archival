5
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,711
[Ares] Just feel that pressure!

6
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,839
I've never seen him transform like that.

7
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,924
[Hermes] <i>If Zeus were in top shape,</i>

8
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,510
<i>he could sustain that form
for 12 or 13 minutes.</i>

9
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,221
<i>But with the damage he's taken,
he'll barely last five.</i>

10
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,348
Don't get too rowdy, old man.

11
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,976
Heaven is breakable, you know.

12
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,063
[narrator] <i>Zeus had compressed
his muscles to their very limits.</i>

13
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,232
<i>They screamed
with the effort of containing</i>

14
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,609
<i>such an enormous amount of energy.</i>

15
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,946
<i>Adam subconsciously raised
his fists in defense,</i>

16
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:39,617
<i>as if his instincts were warning him of
an encounter with a yet unknown creature.</i>

17
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,212
<i>Zeus' final form, Adamas!</i>

18
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:56,843
<i>Adamas's killer move allows Zeus to store
up energy by compressing his muscles,</i>

19
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,637
<i>then unleash a single high-speed punch.</i>

20
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:04,517
<i>The move's simplicity is what
gives it its unparalleled power.</i>

21

[Heimdall] Incredible!

24
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,778
Adam even managed to copy
Zeus's mighty straight!

25
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,073
God's True Left!

26
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,328
Whoa! Zeus doesn't miss a beat!

27
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,791
Once more, Adam returns the blow!

00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,126

29
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,337

[Heimdall] It just keeps going!

34
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,934
Throwing out punch after punch!

35
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,603
Even though Adam's flurry
comes right back!

36
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,776
{\an8}I'll admit this is a heck of a battle,
but talk about wasted effort.

37
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,820
Adam's Divine Reflection
can see through anything and everything

38
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,656
old man Zeus tries to hit him with!

39
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,950
Adam's got this in the bag.

40
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,245
- [gasping] Oh no!
- Huh?

41
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,917
[crackling]

42
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,126
[grunting]

43
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,963
Huh? What's this?

44
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:19,050
Adam's dodged every attack,
but his nose is bleeding!

45
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,470
Wait a minute.
Why does Adam have a nosebleed?

46
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,684
- His mind and body are overheating!
- [gasping]

47
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,271
All this time, Zeus has been
throwing out different punches.

48
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,524
So many, I didn't realize
he'd started using his killer move.

49
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:38,903
All those punches Adam just evaded
are supposed to be impossible to dodge!

50
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,448
He's gotta be in agony.

51
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,325
Since the outset of this battle,

52
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,996
Adam hasn't stopped using
Divine Reflection for a single second.

53
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,956
Seeing through a god's attacks

54
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,959
is devastating his neural circuits!

55
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,672
So if the fight keeps going like this,
is Adam going to make it through?

56
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,676
I can't believe he found a way
to beat Divine Reflection

57
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,553
just by powering
through it like a gorilla!

58
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,931
That stupid, fucking, knuckle<i>-</i> dragging,
over-the-hill, piece-of-shit, old bastard!

59
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,058
[ravens] Overheating?

60
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,186
{\an8}Yep. That human isn't
gonna last much longer.

61
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,982
Then that would mean Zeus's victory
in this fight is all but guaranteed!

62
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,694
[cawing] Serves you right,
you copycat bastard!

63
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,612
[laughing]

64
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,907
[Loki] Ah, ah, ah.
Don't count your chickens, bird.

65
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,617
Take a look.

66
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,958
No! No, it can't be!

67
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,919
His muscles will explode into
tiny pieces like birdseed.

68
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,173
That rush isn't gonna
last forever, you know.

69
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,759
The old man's body
is at its breaking point.

70
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,011
He's also on the edge of overheating.

71
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,222
I've never seen
Zeus fight for his life before.

72
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,640
How beautiful.

73
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,808
[snapping]

74
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,064
Let me explain
with a little visual aid here.

75
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:01,110
Which of these glasses' lifeblood
will spill over first?

76
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,910
It's all a matter of endurance.

77
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,582
[Zeus straining]

78
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,211

[Loki whistling]

80
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,216
Ooh, it's close.

81
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,594
They're both so close to bursting open
I can almost taste it.

82
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,889
All it'll take is the tiniest little push...

83
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,060
{\an8}[slurping]
...and their glasses will overflow.

84

it was only a matter of time...</i>

91
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:14,058
How lame.
They're both still hanging in there.

92
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,813
[narrator] <i>The purity of these
two warriors fighting for their lives</i>

93

<i>Before anyone had realized it,</i>

95
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:28,030
<i>the beauty of the fight inspired god
and man alike to rise to their feet.</i>

96
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,784
- Listen, Hermes.
- Yes. What is it, brother Ares?

97
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:36,289
I never knew that a mere fight
could be a thing of such splendor.

98
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,749
Indeed. I never knew either.

99

[Brünnhilde] <i>Adam...</i>

[male god 1] Hey, Adam!
Your attacks won't do shit against Zeus!

00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,146
- [humans] Father! Father! Father!
- [man1] Hurry up and die, Zeus!

104
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:07,320
Hey! Don't you dare stop now.
Don't ever stop, you hear me?

105
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,376
You can do this, Adam. I know you can.

106
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,880
Please let Papa win.
Please, Zeus, I'm begging you.

107
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,385
[Cain] <i>Die, die, die, die,
die, die, die, die, die!</i>

109
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,226
Father! Father!

110

<i>The Valhalla Arena
had reached a fever pitch,</i>

<i>but the first person to realize
just how things would play out,</i>

112
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,902
<i>was none other than Adam himself.</i>

113
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,823
<i>Most things that happen in this world
are set in motion by small events.</i>

114
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,326

<i>Even a raging, furious storm</i>

[shattering]

119
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,743
[Heimdall] A clean hit!

120
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,247
Zeus's fist finally
makes contact with Adam!

121
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,582
[Zeus grunting]

122
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,335
[Heimdall] Whoa! Adam takes another hit.

123
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:51,173
Zeus follows up. He unleashes
a violent barrage of punches.

124
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:56,053
Adam tries to block, but Zeus
makes him his personal punching bag!

125
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:59,890
But Brünnhilde, Adam isn't moving.
He's not moving!

126
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,394
It's likely taking everything he has
just to keep blocking.

127
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,773
I doubt Adam's eyes can even see anymore.

128
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,068
[Loki] Huh?

129
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,905
Looks like Adam was the first one
to overflow after all.

130
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,576
There's no way
he's coming back from this one.

131
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,578
Yeah, it's all over now.

132
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,789
But I sure have to give
that Adam guy some credit.

133
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,875
He was one hell of a man.

134
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,046
Hm? Uh, not that I'm rooting
for him or anything.

[whimpering] Adam, no.
Please. Please stop this.

138
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,603
Father, that's enough!

139
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,646
{\an8}You don't have to keep on fighting.

Dad, you idiot.

141
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:55,279
Dad, you have to give up.
Just surrender already!

[ravens gasping]

173
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,557
[gasping]

174
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,435
This... This can't be happening.

175
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,479
Uh, Zeus?

176
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,231
[exhaling slowly]

177
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,526
The battle is over.

178
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,443
[Heimdall gasping]

179
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,946
[humans cheering]

180
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,698
Hell yeah! You kicked his ass, Dad!

181
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,243
- All right!
- Amazing, darling.

182
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,662
[Zeus breathing heavily]

183
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:51,997
Huh?

184
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,090
[gasping]

185
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,676
- Huh?
- Huh?

186
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,637
[Heimdall] He... He's dead...

187
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,974
Somehow, Adam has died on his feet!

188
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,184
[sorrowful music playing]

189
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,312
[Zeus chuckling] Took you long enough.

190
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,313
Huh?

191
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:21,068
Adam breathed his last
long before I fell. [chuckling]

192
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,738
Even still, he stayed standing.

193
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,699
[breathing heavily]

194
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,203
{\an8}An impressive feat on its own,
but that's not all he did.

195
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:36,709
[Zeus] <i>Even after his death,
that stubborn human,</i>

196
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,671
<i>he never stopped throwing punches.</i>

197
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,185
Well, kiddo,

198
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,981
looks like it's gramps's ass
that hit the ground first.

199
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,985
But what a fight.
Never met a man so impressive.

200
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,737
[all sobbing]

201
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:07,906
[glass shattering]

202
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:13,412
[Zeus sighing] If this were
purely a contest of endurance,

203
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,124
victory would have been yours.

204
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,221
[humans screaming]

205
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:35,643
The second round of the battle
between god and man, Ragnarok,

206
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,436
has been decided!

207
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,730
The winner is Zeus!

208
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,315
[narrator] <i>Two losses in a row.</i>

209
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,984
<i>The humans now faced
a desperate situation.</i>

210
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,487
<i>But did any one of them despair?</i>

211
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,283
<i>They did not.</i>

212
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:56,872
<i>Their father, Adam, had bestowed upon his
children a vitally important precedent.</i>

213
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,459
<i>Adam showed them for the first time</i>

214
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,838
<i>that humanity could fight back
against the gods.</i>

215
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,299
ZEUS VS. ADAM
TIME: 7 MINUTES, 13 SECONDS

216
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,843
WINNING ATTACK: FISTS
WINNER: ZEUS

217
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,436
Brünnhilde, what happened out there?

218
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,854
Start talking, Brünnhilde!

219
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,691
Göll, you need to calm down now.

220
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,238
Hrist... You saw it too, didn't you?

221
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,824
{\an8}Those brass knuckles didn't even
have a single scratch on them!

222
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,158
{\an8}HRIST
SECOND OF THE 13 VALKYRIE

223
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:37,538
She did her job and fought her hardest,
so why did our sister Leif have to die?

224
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,123
[sighing]

225
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:43,419
{\an8}In truth, the act of Völundr
merges human with Valkyrie.

226
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,463
They become as one,
united in both body and soul.

227
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,510
{\an8}A Valkyrie doesn't merely transform
into a weapon through Völundr.

228
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,263
Her fate is bonded to her wielder's.

229
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,057
We fight together, and...

230
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,810
we live or die together.

231
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,895
[whimpering]

232
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,029
[sobbing]

233
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,114
Please don't cry, Göll.

234
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,199
Leif was prepared for this.

235
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,660
She knew how dangerous
her battle would be.

236
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,412
Every Valkyrie does.

237
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,332
A time may come when you too
must prepare to follow in our footsteps,

238
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,209
{\an8}and put your life on the line.

239
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,046
But I never even got the chance
to say goodbye,

240
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,174
to tell her how much I love her,
do something kind for her.

241
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,009
- Göll...
- Hrist...

242
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,596
- [squishing]
- Ow, ow, ow, ow...

243
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,475
That hurts, Hrist.
Why are you squeezing me so-- [squealing]

244
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,062
I'll get my revenge on those
piece of shit gods.

245
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:47,983
Once I'm through with them, there won't
be enough left to scream for mercy.

246
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,236
[Göll shivering] <i>That's right. I forgot.</i>

247
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,322
<i>Hrist is the only one of us Valkyrie</i>

248
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,658
<i>with two powers
and two personalities in the same body!</i>

249
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,369
{\an8}[narrator] <i>"Hrist."
The name has two meanings.</i>

250
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,665
{\an8}<i>"The trembling one"
and "the thundering one."</i>

251
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:08,378
Ah! Let's all simmer down now, Hrist.
If that's okay.

252
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,547
[chewing and slurping]

253
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,176
[growling]

254
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,678
[Göll exclaiming fearfully]

255
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,972
Stupid wrinkly old bastard!

256
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,517
Thinks he can get away
with eating my apple, does he?

257
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:25,646
That's not good.

258
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,732
She's eating her gross,
salty licorice pies again.

259
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,442
She always starts
wolfing those things down

260
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,028
whenever she's stressed out
or in a really bad mood.

261
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,365
[Brünnhilde] <i>If we lose the next one,
it'll be three in a row.</i>

262
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:40,202
<i>We have to win. We have to
win this next round, no matter what!</i>

263
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,703
[phone beeping]

264
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,959
- [gasping]
- [dishes shattering]

265
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,129
Whoa, what did
you do that for, Brünnhilde?

266
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,922
Is something the matter, sister?

267
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,176
[Hrist and Göll] Poseidon?

268
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,429
{\an8}Then they intend to break
our spirit as soon as possible.

269
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,849
Wait, they're sending in Poseidon already?

270
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,309
Why are the gods bringing out
the big guns in round three?

271
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,728
Like, let us warm up
before you steamroll us.

272
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,646
[Göll crying]

273
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,275
Oh no, I just remembered that Poseidon's
actually Zeus' older brother!

274
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,819
I bet that guy's totally unstoppable.

275
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,070
Why did it have to be him?

276
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,448
Hey, are you doing all right, big sister?
It feels like we're done for.

277
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,577
{\an8}Also, is it just me or do you think
the gods are trying to end this early

278
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,996
{\an8}- with a seven to zero score?
- Göll...

279
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,709
Could you please shut your adorable
little mouth for just a second?

280
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:34,089
If you don't, I'm afraid I might have to
cut your cute little head clean off.

281
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,800
[sobbing]

282
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,596
[Göll] <i>Her voice is so sweet,
but her words are so scary!</i>

283
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:45,058
<i>I thought Hrist had a messed up
personality but Brünnhilde is worse.</i>

284
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,977
[dinging]

285
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,858
[Brünnhilde] <i>We're at the cliff's edge,
and the gods just keep pushing us back.</i>

286
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:54,776
<i>So who?</i>

287
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,695
<i>Damn it, who?</i>

288
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,698
<i>Is there a human in history</i>

289
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,534
<i>who could stand against Poseidon,
the lord of the seas?</i>

290
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,913
- Uh?
- [gasping]

291
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,127
<i>When did he...?</i>

292
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,671
It would be my honor.

293
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,054
- Huh?
- Huh?

294
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,472
He's sure?

295
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,562
When you say "my honor,"
you mean that you're Sasaki Kojiro?

296
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,480
{\an8}For real?

297
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,690
{\an8}I mean, you look totally
different from your picture.

298
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,111
{\an8}Not to be rude, but you're kind of,
I don't know, old and shriveled.

299
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,905
What the heck's going on here?

300
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,949
I thought when a soul
was summoned to Ragnarok,

301
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,117
no matter how old
that person was when they died,

302
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:47,371
they would be summoned in their physical
prime, not as some crusty old geezer.

303
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,622
Isn't that how it works?

304
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,624
That is how it works.

305
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,251
And yet, this man claims to--

306
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,926
[whooshing]

307
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,095
Ugh.

308
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,474
Oh.

309
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,686
Cow's milk, was it? Ah yes. Good stuff.

310
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,603
Hm?

311
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,065
Oh.

312
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,651
Mm. What is this?

313
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:21,238
Ah! Whatever it is, it's delicious. Mmm.

314
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,823
He's loving that crap.

315
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,493
Okay, yeah. There's no way
that this old weirdo's the real Kojiro.

316
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,621
Hm, I must say. That was a real treat.

317
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,916
[Brünnhilde] <i>He's certainly not
what I expected.</i>

318
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:37,879
<i>But still, right before our eyes,
he moved with the grace of a master.</i>

319
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,091
{\an8}The man before us is the real thing.

320
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,343
Hm.

321
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,306
It's been 400 years since
I was called up to heaven,

322
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,601
{\an8}Since then, I have tirelessly worked
to hone my swordsmanship.

323
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:55,105
The nature of my <i>Ganryu</i>
has never stopped evolving.

324
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,857
[shimmering]

325
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:02,279
In other words, this old Kojiro
is a swordsman in his prime!
