[narrator] <i>In the aftermath
of the carnage,</i>

4
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:57,200
<i>Ares attempted to make sense
of the phenomenon he had just witnessed.</i>

5
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,580
I'm not proud to say this,
so allow me to be direct.

6
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,709
Not to sound arrogant,
but I am the god of war.

7
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,628
I've seen my fair share of fights.

8
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,966
{\an8}<i>When it comes to moves like the Meteor Jab
or the Divine Axe,</i>

9
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:18,179
they're so swift that lesser gods
fail to glimpse even a shadow of the fray.

10
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,431
That was hardly an issue for me,
of course.

11
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,599
I saw them.

12
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,351
Except...

13
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,061
All right.

14
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,106
Let's see if you can copy this one.

15
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,899
Brace yourself!

16
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,113
I was alert.

17
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,614
Understand?

18
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,909
On the blessed names of the gods,
my gaze never strayed once.

19
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,620
Not even for a slight
fraction of a second.

20
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,581
But in one moment,

21
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,417
I saw my father
shape his hand into a fist,

22
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,336
and in the next instant, it was all over.

23
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,301
Before I knew it,

24
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,346
<i>his skull was facing
in the wrong direction.</i>

25
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,728
Huh? Huh!? What in the realm is going on?

26
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,732
The lord of the heavens,
the creator of the universe,

27
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,444
the indomitable Zeus
has crumpled to the ground!

28
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,405
Wait. But, how?

29
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:20,491
This turn of events, it's unprecedented.

30
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,371
I don't understand what happened.
What is the meaning of this madness?

31
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,458
I was looking right at them,
but I didn't see anything.

32
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,251
How interesting.

33
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,045
The human's powers are impressive.

34
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,089
Perhaps his strength is more formidable
than we initially thought.

35
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,049
Uh...

36
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,926
It went like this.

37
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,972
Master Zeus closed in
to perform his final attack.

38
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,892
<i>Still, Adam was undeterred.</i>

39
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,938
<i>He replicated those movements
at the same time.</i>

40
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,106
[shimmering]

41
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,613
<i>He managed to dodge
the oncoming blow by a whisker.</i>

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,239
<i>Like so.</i>

43
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,158
[slamming]

44
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,663
Then he threw his own punch.

45
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,291
Wait a second.

46
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,462
Are you saying
you're able to see everything?

47
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,964
In spite of the fact that I,

48
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,549
the god of war,
could not perceive what you described?

49
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,428
What? No. It's merely a casual hypothesis,

50
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,348
{\an8}and nothing more, dear brother.

51
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,849
Huh?

52
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,518
[grumbling]

53
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,528
[Ares] <i>In any case,</i>

54
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,490
<i>I was none the wiser about what had
transpired before my very eyes.</i>

55
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,619
<i>And yet, I was unshakably
certain about one thing at least.</i>

56
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,955
<i>In the end,</i>

57
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,666
<i>even if I were to train for 1,000 years,</i>

58
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,752
<i>I would never outpace Adam.</i>

59
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,797
You can't say I didn't warn you.

60
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,799
I told you you'd regret this, right?

61
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,553
Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.
Oh my god. Oh my goodness, folks!

62
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,389
I can hardly believe it,
but as you can see...

63
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,183
the mighty boss god is down!

64
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,519
Down for the count!

65
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,567
We are witnessing the first true miracle
since the birth of the cosmos!

66
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,569
[humans cheering wildly]

67
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,740
[crows cawing]

68
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,368
Well, not too bad.
The boy has some talent.

69
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,705
What are you doing, old man?
Quit messing around and get up!

70
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,248
He's amazing.

71
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,875
That human is way too strong.

72
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,628
I get that his special power is
the ability to mimic the god's attacks,

73
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,298
but being able to surpass them
is on a whole other level.

74
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,135
Like, what is this Adam guy made of
that makes him so unbreakable?

75
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,970
Didn't I tell you already?

76
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,724
The source of that man's strength lies in
his relentless will and firm conviction.

77
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,809
- That's why he's strong?
- Oh yes.

78
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,563
He loathes the gods with all his heart.

79
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,399
He hates them?

<i>He enjoyed a life of comfort
basking in the endless bounty of nature.</i>

86
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,188
<i>But these days would soon end.</i>

What does it matter, you filthy worm?

176
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,555
I'll slice you into pieces,

177

Are you all right?

00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,863
I'm so sorry for making you do this.

192
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,324
Good thing I was doing it for us.

You charmer.

194
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,998
Are you ready to get out of here?

Congratulations, darling!

Beautiful! A second Renaissance!

202
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,825
See that, Mom? Dad is totally
cleaning up out there, isn't he?

203
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,828
- He sure is.
- [giggling]

204
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,580
He actually KO'd a god!

205
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,126
[Heimdall] With this,
revenge has been served.

206

Adam has finally turned the pain
of his exile back against the creators.

207
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,550
He's rubbing it in their faces.

208
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,678
We did lose the last fight,
but now we're even again!

209
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,013
Ragnarok round two is a complete victory!

210
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,851
Honestly, I felt nervous when Zeus
chose to barge in uninvited.

211
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,771
But he was the perfect opponent.
All's well that ends well.

212
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,189
Whatever.

213
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,691
I'm just happy that the human

214
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,652
found a strategy to hang
that old geezer out to dry!

215
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,028
It's too good!

- Amazing work!
- Get him, Adam. That's right.

They'll regret ever wanting to ban you
from paradise in the first place.

[Heimdall] Okay,
it's time to call this fight.

Round two of Ragnarok
winds down to an official end.

Looks like father caught his second wind.

235
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,709
I knew my old man
had some fight left in him.

236
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,753
- There's still cause for concern.
- Huh?

237
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,880
He took quite a beating.

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,716
[panting]

239
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,513
Come on, gramps. You shouldn't
be pushing yourself this hard.

240
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,099
I understand now.

241
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:38,395
I'm beginning to realize that all that
big talk wasn't just for show.

242
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,148
I'm getting a better idea
of what's beneath the leaf.

243
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,858
But there's still one thing

244
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,111
that this withered noggin
of mine can't make sense of.

245
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,323
They say no one hates us more than you do.

246
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,660
When I look at you, I don't see
even a single ounce of resentment.

247
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,663
So if you'd be so kind to indulge me.

248
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,541
What's the reason you want to
go toe-to-toe against the gods?

00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,962
[sighing]

250
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,047
Everybody's always
asking me that question.

251
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,424
And it seems now you are too.

252
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,301
Is it hatred?

253
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,761
Or revenge?

254
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,930
Why does it matter?

255
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,682
That's irrelevant.

256
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,184
Is there any man alive who needs a reason...

257
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,691
to protect his very own children?

[uplifting Gregorian chant music playing]

259
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,865
Well said.

260
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,742
Always with the mushy stuff.

261
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,868
You can say that again.

spontaneously achieved consensus!

have been me fighting out there.

is so cool I can barely stand it!

275
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:25,252
It appears I underestimated
the quality of his moral character.

276
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,006
He really is the paragon of mankind.

277
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,342

00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,387

It would have been better for you
if you'd stayed on the ground.

282
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,773
Careful, this next one will kill you.

284
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,819
{\an8}I can tell you aren't bluffing
by the sound of it.

285
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,908
Though it pains me to say it,
I admit you're a tough contender.

286
00:17:55,908 --> 00:18:00,162
- If you want to surrender, then maybe--
- I didn't say I was finished.

287
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,583
I thought I could do away with you
using the usual technique.

288
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,544
But that was rather naive of me.

289
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,756
I didn't want to resort to this
since it's so draining,

290
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,800
but I'm left with no other choice!

292
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,888
It's my only option.

What's going on?
Master Zeus is contorting his body.

297
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,485
- He's all flesh.
- Disgusting.

298
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,778
What is he doing?

299
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,780
My, he's so repulsive.

300
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,407
Well, well, what do we have here?

301
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,284
What's he trying to accomplish?

302
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,454
I say the so-called maker of the universe
has gone senile.

303
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,665
[male god] You two have it twisted.

304
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,749
Huh?

[ravens cawing]

306
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,464
I should devour you birdbrains whole!

307
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,094
- Unhand me, you maniac.
- Please, have mercy.

308
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,346
Didn't I warn you?

309
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,808
Don't ever transform into my son again.

310
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,814
[laughing] Hey, I was joking.

311
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,024
There's nothing wrong with a little prank.

312
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,904
Oh, my bad. I forgot.
You don't have a sense of humor.

313
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,366
[screaming] Who are you?

314
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,829
I respect you too much to ever
eat your precious pet birds, Uncle Odin.

GOD OF DECEIT

316
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,374
Hmm.

317
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,253
The first time I've seen him
go beast-mode in, like, a billion years.

318
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,131
It's a bona fide spectacle
on the rare occasion he does it.

319
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,842
That human's making me turn
green with envy.

320
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,261
All of it's totally unfair.

321
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,971
Huh? In what way?

322
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:45,767
I'll say this. It's extremely difficult
getting the old man to fight for real.

323
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,730
{\an8}Thinking about it makes me so jealous,
I could...

00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,702
Hmm.

327
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,914
He looks different. Something's happening.

328
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,292
Master Zeus, he's transforming.

329
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,964
[ominous music playing]

330
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:20,552
What a sight. He's writhing
in agony while reshaping himself.

331
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,098
[shuddering]

332
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,101
[moaning]

333
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,526
[screaming]

334
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,615
[gasping]

335
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,261
[gasping]

336
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,275
Is that Master Zeus?

337
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,278
- [gods murmuring]
- [male god] Zeus?

338
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,780
[woman] What is that monstrosity?

339
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,371
[Göll] Wait, what's happening?
Why are my hands trembling?

340
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,499
I can't seem to stop it.
It feels so weird.

341
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,792
Why do I-- Ah!

342
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,546
I'm not sure either.
It might be our instincts kicking in.

343
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,548
- Or something.
- Instincts?

344
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:44,303
It's the gut feeling you get,
when you're in unspeakable danger.

345
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,306
Mm-hm. I've never seen
anything more beautiful.

346
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,227
The glory of grandfather's ultimate form.
