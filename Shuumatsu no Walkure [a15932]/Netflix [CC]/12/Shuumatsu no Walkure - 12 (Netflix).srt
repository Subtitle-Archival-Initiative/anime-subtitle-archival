<i>I'm so glad she's safe.</i>

181
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:32,788
So now, humanity's shown the gods
they're worthy of survival, right?

182
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,748
- [Brünnhilde] No.
- Huh?

183
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,169
We still have six victories to claim.

184
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,089
I really hope that we're able to win this.

210

We might as well just admit it,

apologize.

225
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,672
But surely you understand that a Greek god

226
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,134
must be the one
to take revenge for another.

{\an8}Huh?

[crowd gasping]

254
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:57,386
The fighter representing humanity has
requested that the fight take place here,

255
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,472
and the fighter for the gods
graciously accepted.

to a historic first.

It's god versus man in
a knock-down, drag-out street fight!

259
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,736
[woman] Does the weird arena mean
that the gods are giving us

260
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,156
some sort of special advantage
or something?

261
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,657

262
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,951
Those wimpy humans are embarrassing.

263
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,078
They'll lose even with the advantage.

264
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,670
[Heimdall] I can't even imagine
how this battle will unfold.

265
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,840
Now, representing humanity in round four,

266
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,300
is this man.

267
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,597
Friday, August 31st, 1888,

268
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:47,269
a monster emerged from a dense fog
of the city with his fangs sharp and bare.

269
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:52,649
Was murdering five prostitutes during
his reign of terror the ultimate goal?

270
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,692
No.

271
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,196
- Was it to destroy society?
- No.

272
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,114
This lone man

273
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:04,453
plunged the three million citizens
of London into the very depths of fear.

274
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,498
He's the vilest of the vile,
with a heart of pure darkness!

275
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:14,421
His moniker is that of the most infamous
killer in the history of mankind!

276
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,351
{\an8}Jack the Ripper!

277
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,687
Jack the Ripper?

278
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,522
- [man 4] What, he's here?
- [man 5] No way!

279
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,815
[man 6] That's the real Jack?

280
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,319
[man 7] The greatest mystery in the
history of crime is right in front of us.

281
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,947
[man 8] No, this is insane!

282
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,950
Why'd they pick a serial killer
to represent humanity?

283
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:47,412
[chuckling] Well now.
So that's the choice you decided to make.

284
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,043
I'll give you credit for one thing,

285
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,462
she always fights dirty.

286
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,802
And now, the god who intends
to avenge his brethren's defeat.

287
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,471
This fighter needs no introduction.

288
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,598
But I'm gonna give him one anyway.

289
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:12,521
The valiant warrior who felled both
the Nemean Lion and Cerberus

290
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,231
with his bare hands.

291
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,567
He accomplished the 12 labors
imposed upon him

292
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,779
and ascended to become
half-human, half-god.

293
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,911
- [horses whinnying]
- The bringer of light to heaven and earth,

the unrivaled hero...

296
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,427
{\an8}Hercules!

297
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,890
[male god 1] Hercules! Yeah!

298
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,810
- [male god 2] You're the best!
- [female god 1] Yeah, Hercules!

299
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,148
- We're all waiting for you, Hercules.
- Don't let those bad guys win.

300
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,818
- [male god 3] You're our hero forever!
- [male god 4] You can do it, Big Herc!

301
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,570

[Heimdall] Good versus evil.
Evil versus good.

{\an8}Has there ever been a battle that drew
those lines more clearly than this one?

306
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,298
And now, it begins!
