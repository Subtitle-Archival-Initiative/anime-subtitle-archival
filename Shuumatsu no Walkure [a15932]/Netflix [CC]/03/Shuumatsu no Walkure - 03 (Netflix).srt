1
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,942
We 11 Valkyries have answered your call,

2
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,695
and by your wishes have assembled here.

3
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,780
What is it you need from us?

4
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,408
[Göll] Oh, our sisters.

5
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,621
Brünnhilde, may I ask
what it is you're planning?

6
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,541
I don't understand.
How can the other Valkyries help?

7
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,044
Greetings, Randgriz. Step forth.

8
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,632
Right. Very well.

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,473
{\an8}RANDGRIZ
FOURTH OF THE 13 VALKYRIE

10
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,767
It's nice to see a familiar face.

11
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,730
Let's not dawdle, then.

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,399
I trust you have knowledge
of Thor's Divine Treasures.

13
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,735
Why, but of course.

14
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,406
<i>First, there are the iron gauntlets,
which can block off any attack,</i>

15
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,075
<i>the Járngreipr.</i>

16
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,244
<i>Then, there's Mjölnir,</i>

17
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,373
<i>the hammer that became legend
when it defeated the Jötunn army.</i>

18
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,294
That's right.

19
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,172
The two powerful weapons
wielded by the god of thunder.

20
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,133
They're the pride of heaven,
but they're damn cheap if you ask me.

21
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,177
Uh, that language...

22
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,305
For us to stand a chance against Thor,

23
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,933
we'll need to outclass
those armaments of his.

24
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,814
If you would be so kind, then go ahead
and offer yourself, Randgriz.

25
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,525
As you wish, sister.

26
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,193
With the utmost pleasure.

27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,946
Uh, hold on.

28
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,572
Offer yourself how?

29
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,420
[heavy metal music playing]

30
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:30,919
KILLER MOVE

31
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,838
- [crowd cheering]
- [intense operatic music playing]

32
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,347
[Heimdall] Whoa, what's going on?

33
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,849
There's light from Lü Bu's halberd!

34
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,351
Is it starting to glow?

35
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,604
Curious. I sensed this.

36
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,105
Something strange.

37
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,857
Wait, could this be...

38
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,108
Huh?

39
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,362
- Isn't that thing...?
- That's impossible!

40
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,447
[Brünnhilde] <i>Feast your eyes.</i>

41
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,743
<i>Behold the vast power
that lies deep within each Valkyrie.</i>

42
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,205
<i>It's our trick for leveling
the playing field against the gods.</i>

43
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,748
<i>Cheat for cheat.</i>

44
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,667
<i>Witness transcendence!</i>

45
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,795
[narrator] <i>When a Valkyrie
transforms her body</i>

46
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,964
<i>into the form of an earthly weapon,</i>

47
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,467
<i>the one who holds it wields a godly arm.</i>

48
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,303
<i>In other words, a Divine Treasure.</i>

49
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,764
<i>And that power has a name.</i>

50
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,024
[Randgriz] <i>Divine Treasure Forge!</i>

51
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,538
<i>Völundr!</i>

52
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,665
[shimmering]

53
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,839
[metallic ringing]

54
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:17,442
Now that is an unyielding blade,
for an unyielding foe!

55
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,613
If this is the afterlife...

56
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,784
consider me impressed.

57
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,829
[narrator] <i>When Völundr
is cast on a weapon,</i>

58
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,624
<i>it inherits the attributes
of the Valkyrie who performed it.</i>

59
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,129
<i>The fourth eldest Valkyrie is Randgriz.</i>

60
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,631
<i>Her name translates to...</i>

61
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,259
<i>"Shield Destroyer"!</i>

62
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,762
<i>Then there's Mjölnir,</i>

63
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,223
<i>one of the mightiest instruments
of the Divine Treasures.</i>

64
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,768
<i>With enough force to shatter the earth,</i>

65
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,562
<i>power flows from it like lava</i>

66
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,274
<i>capable of incinerating

00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,567
<i>According to the</i> Edda,

68
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,863
<i>Thor must wear Járngreipr
to protect his hands from his hammer,</i>

69
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,240
<i>as one cannot brandish it without it.</i>

70
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,162
<i>Járngreipr, a formidable counter
to the most formidable weapon,</i>

71
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,499
<i>and therefore the most sturdy

72
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,461
[shattering]

73
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,716
<i>Till now, this sight
should have been impossible to see.</i>

74
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,967
[grunts excitedly]

75
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,719
That's our Griz for you!

76
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,472
[Heimdall] What? He pulverized it.

77
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,224
A Divine Treasure!

78
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,601
He's managed to do the unthinkable!

79
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,356
Lü Bu has crushed Járngreipr
like a potato chip!

80
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,109
- Excellent!
- Yeah! Nice!

81
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,611
{\an8}- [crowd cheering]
- Eat your hearts out, you pathetic gods.

82
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,491
Lü Bu's the strongest man in
the Three Kingdoms, so pay your respects!

83
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,244
I bet you're pissing yourselves, huh?

84
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,371
[growling angrily]

85
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,374
[laughing happily]

86
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,792
Huh?

87
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,340
Enough, Zhang Fei, it is not
in our place to cackle so boastfully.

88
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,134
Oh, I'm sorry.

89
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,887
- Well, that would be proper etiquette.
- Hm.

90
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,431
But as one who shared an era with him,

91
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,100
who witnessed his courage,

92
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,978
I cannot deny it.

93
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,897
A pride that burns from my soul.

94
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,900
[soldiers chanting]

95
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,037
All hail Lü Bu!

96
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,499
[soldiers] All hail!

97
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,337
That strike was incredible!

98
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,757
Your strategy is beyond compare!

99
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,718
My liege!

100
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,180
Tha... That was flawlessly executed.

101
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,516
Look how you're enjoying yourself.

102
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:02,106
To fall on my sword,
and to rise once again in your name,

103
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,108
is truly an honor!

104
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,570
[humans in crowd shouting encouragement]

105
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,578
[man 1] The skills of that man...

106
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,955
He's tougher than steel!

107
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,874
[man 2] That guy's stronger than an ox.

108
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,878
[narrator] <i>In that moment,
the people trembled in anticipation.</i>

109
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,631
<i>For this was more than history.</i>

110
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,550
<i>Since the dawn of the human race,</i>

111
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,136
<i>nobody had ever managed to surpass a god.</i>

112
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,389
<i>This was unprecedented.</i>

113
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,603
How curious.

114
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,897
So that's the truth
of this entire charade.

115
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,650
Ah, you're catching on?

116
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,152
As you know, a Valkyrie's sworn to duty.

117
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,155
She's the bearer of souls.

118
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,533
<i>Descending upon the Earth,</i>

119
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,161
<i>they look for the finest warriors
and summon them to Valhalla,</i>

120
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:01,457
<i>forming a divine army to prepare
for some impending heavenly crisis.</i>

121
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,671
But, conversely, I've also heard some
unsavory rumors floating about.

122
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:11,550
<i>They say that these preparations aren't
merely for an assault against the gods.</i>

123
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,678
<i>Now, according to the legends,</i>

124
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,889
<i>the Valkyries form a bond
with the heroes they have chosen,</i>

125
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,102
<i>transforming themselves into the most
perfect weapon suitable for that warrior.</i>

126
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,105
<i>In this way,
the sisters grant them their powers,</i>

127
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,274
<i>which rival those of the gods.</i>

128
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,780
And the name of that special skill...

129
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,199
is Völundr!

130
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,078
It's a magical process of metamorphosis.

131
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,579
[whooshing]

132
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,377
With their newfound ability
to face off against the gods,

133
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,004
the vanguard will attack.

134
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,549
In essence, a Ragnarok.

135
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,426
[splashing]

136
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,678
[grunting]

137
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,931
Of course, I understand now.

138
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,683
This isn't a challenge.

139
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,437
In truth, it's actually
a bold-faced rebellion!

140
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,773
[coughing and groaning]

141
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,693
[grumbling] Those girls.

142
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,822
I never imagined they would
take up arms against us.

143
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:19,994
Why, since the Big Bang,
this is the most insufferable,

144
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,579
unspeakable...

145
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,708
[shouting] extraordinary thrill
I've ever felt!

146
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,210
Ah ha!

147
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,758
My heart is on fire!

148
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,844
[inhaling deeply]

149
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,054
Huh?

150
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:44,018
Br... Br... Br...

151
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,896
- Brünnhilde!
- [Göll whimpering]

152
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:51,317
Brünnhilde! Where are you, my sweet?

153
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,112
[Brünnhilde] <i>You might wanna
stop leering at us, you pervy old lech.</i>

154
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,906
- [crowd murmuring]
- [gasping]

155
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,911
[sizzling]

156
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,580
[man 3] Goodness, what is that?

157
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,915
[man 4] What's happening?

158
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,422
Huh?

159
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,299
What's going on here, sis?

160
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,801
Uh, I'm confused.

161
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,636
[gasping]

162
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,058
[Zhang Fei] Careful down there, Lü Bu.

163
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,643
[man 5] It's red hot.

164
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,854
[crowd chattering]

165
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,107
That hammer's beginning to smoke.

166
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,858
I wouldn't wanna touch that.

167
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,443
Could this be...?

168
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,362
Look, his weapon is starting to melt.

169
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,864
It's turning into
a big puddle of hot lava.

170
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,160
[Heimdall] Well, what a spectacular sight!

171
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,122
It's as broiling hot as the legends say.

172
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,873
Talk about unexpected.

173
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,877
But whatever the reason,
Thor may be in trouble.

174
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,589
Because now that the god of thunder
has lost one of the Járngreipr,

175
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,260
he's going to have a tough time
wielding Mjölnir with both arms.

176
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,846
Surely this is a joke, right?

177
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,056
Does this mean he can't use it anymore?

178
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,642
No way. [whimpering]

179
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,144
- [thumping]
- Huh?

180
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,771
- [thumping]
- Huh?

181
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,441
[thumping]

182
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,278
Hey, do you hear
that weird thumping sound?

183
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,780
[thumping]

184
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,784
Hmm. Hm?

185
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,162
[Heimdall] <i>Is that some kind of drum?</i>

186
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,247
[thumping]

187
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,292
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

188
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,044
This is astonishing!

189
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,549
It's not a drum.
It's Mjölnir's heart beat!

190
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,887
[thumping continues]

191
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,727
Finally, you've awoken.

192
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,364
[beating continues]

193
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,414
[screaming] No!
Is that hammer actually pulsing?

194
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:14,001
The hell?
Don't tell me that it's a living creature.

195
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,836
I'm gonna be sick.

196
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,004
Ah!

197
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,964
[Zeus laughing]

198
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,426
About time that hunk of junk
decided to wake up!

199
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,970
"Decided"? Like it's alive.

200
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,931
That's frightening.

201
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,432
[chucking]

202
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:32,269
There's a fallacy
about the legend of the Divine Treasures.

203
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,439
- However, it's a fairly common one.
- [cracking]

204
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,942
Really? What's that?

205
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,694
Why those gloves do exist.

206
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:45,616
In reality, the reason that they're worn
isn't to protect Thor from his hammer.

207
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,201
I'm afraid I don't follow.

208
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:52,039
I'm saying those gloves are there
to keep his power safely contained.

209
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,709
Thor uses them
so he doesn't accidentally crush Mjölnir

210
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,962
with his grip before it activates.

211
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,672
[crashing]

212
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,050
Uh?

213
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,684
[gasping]

214
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,355
[Zhang Fei grumbling]

215
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,816
Hm!

216
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,237
[thumping continues]

217
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,744
Ah, rise and shine, sleepyhead.

218
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,460
[crowd exclaiming]

219
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,463
[chuckling]

220
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,090
One-handed grip.

221
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,466
How mighty.

222
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,384
[gasping]

223
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,262
[Heimdall] Wait, what's he doing?

224
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,555
Human...

225
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,558
No. Your name was Lü Bu.

226
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,852
I have one lone request for you.

227
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,478
Huh?

228
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,901
[crackling]

229
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,739
Don't you die.

230
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,826
Huh? [laughing]

231
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,121
[Heimdall] The stakes have been raised.

232
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:19,460
At last, the mortal hero has inspired
the Norse Force to start getting serious!

233
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,381
It seems like anything could happen next.

234
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,384
Not even the gods can predict
how this one will turn out.

235
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,387
We're in uncharted territory, folks!

236
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,014
[crowd cheering]

237
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,434
- [ringing]
- Uh?

238
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,393
Huh?

239
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,148
Hey! It's against the rules
to check your phone, Brünnhilde!

240
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,276
Hurry up and put it away
before we get into trouble.

241
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,154
[whooshing]

242
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:59,792
[breathing deeply]

243
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,711
Uh, sis, are you okay?

244
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,673
- Ah!
- Well, now we know.

245
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,049
Huh?

246
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,135
The challengers
who will be participating was unknown.

247
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,762
Until now, that is.

248
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,555
The official list was released.

249
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,143
Ah! Wow.

250
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,312
That's a stacked list.

251
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,940
{\an8}ZEUS, BUDDHA, LOKI, APOLLO,
POSEIDON, SUSANOO NO MIKOTO

252
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,067
HERCULES, VAIŚRAVAA, ANUBIS
ODIN, BEELZEBUB, SHIVA

253
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,569
QIN SHI HUANG, KING LEONIDAS
NIKOLA TESLA, KOJIRO SASAKI

254
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,947
JACK THE RIPPER, ADAM,
TAMEEMON RAIDEN, SOJI OKITA, RASPUTIN

255
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,074
NOSTRADAME, SIMO HÄYHÄ, SAKATA NO KINTOKI

256
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:36,829
That's two teams of 13 champions,
whose actions decide everything.

257
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,833
[shivering]

258
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,962
With the fate of the whole
human race at stake.

259
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,839
It's a countdown.

260
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,967
Those 13 people aren't just fighters.

261
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,594
They're the 13 last hopes for mankind.

262
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,306
[scoffs] That sounds desperate.

263
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,934
[giggling] Don't despair.

264
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,646
I have a more suitable name.

265
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:06,066
A proper title that all beings
shall know and revere.

266
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,945
They shall be the 13 god killers!

267
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,697
The Einherjar!

268
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,827
The great saviors of humanity.

269
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,372
The legendary Einherjar!

270
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,880
Lord Zeus,

271
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,550
the participants who will be representing
the human race have been determined.

272
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,136
Oh, let me take a gander.

273
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,140
Oh, that's an intriguing lineup.

274
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,725
[laughing]

275
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,394
This could be
more interesting than I thought!

276
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,606
I can't wait to see how this will go.

277
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,191
[laughing]

278
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,444
[thumping continues]

279
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,078
[Heimdall] All right,
look alive, everybody.

280
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,205
The tension is unbearable.

281
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,918
But the first round of the ultimate
showdown between man and maker continues.

282
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,880
The destiny of the entire human race
hangs by a thread.

283
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,299
And with Thor now at full throttle,

284
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,384
the standoff between the god of thunder

285
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,387
and the champion of China
reaches the apex!

286
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,473
[all murmuring]

287
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,144

00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,896
Lü Bu...

289
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,982
Thor's not kidding around, huh?

290
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,276
I've never seen him
fight like this before.

291
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,153
I don't suppose that I have either.

He dodged the hammer
