Is an aptitude for the sword
what you truly lack, Kojiro?

Kojiro, let's have a match.

97
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,290
I'll admit, you truly were a mighty foe.

98
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,794
So much so that I had to fight you
146 times in my mind

- You what?

- Kojiro didn't even draw.

<i>Kojiro Sasaki's series of defeats</i>

<i>had given rise to an attack
that defied such petty constraints.</i>
