The biggest loser in history

[male god 6] Don't look him in the eye.
He'll skewer you!

30

His aura is so intimidating!

31

My, aren't you a feisty one.

35
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,430
Your comrades are cheering for you.
At least show some gratitude.

36
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,642
I don't see a point in that.

37
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,643
Huh?

38
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,395
A god needs no armies,

39
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,564
nor to resort to betrayal,

40
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,316
for a god is complete.

41
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,152
That's how it has always been.

42
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,949
We have embodied perfection
since the beginning of time.

43
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,702
Why show thanks for the irrelevant?

44
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,583
Huh?

45
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,505
Hmm.

46
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,466
Is that how you operate?

47
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,551
How peculiar.

48
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,388
Huh.

49
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,934
Don't mean to be rude,
but it seems pretty depressing.

50
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,936
[gasping]

00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,406

00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,381
- Huh?
<i>- Chione Tyro Demeter!</i>

56
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,803
CHIONE TYRO DEMETER

57
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,765
Whoa, he's bearing down
like lightning from the sky!

58
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,769
There's no doubt he'll stop at nothing
to deliver the killing blow!

59
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,859
What a mesmerizing display of his agility.

60
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,403
His speed is a genuine wonder to behold.

61
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,240
As impressive as his pace is,
the human can still dodge his attacks.

62
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,577
The sole reason
he evaded anything thus far

63
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,247
is because Poseidon's only used
an inkling of his total strength.

64
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,001
<i>When it comes to
the full depths of his prowess,</i>

65
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,670
<i>not even the gods can fathom such a force.</i>

66
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,132
For that matter, neither can a human.

67
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,636
Hey, gramps, come on,
don't lose out on us!

68
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,973
Because you have to win
this battle for Hrist, okay?

69
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,730
[narrator] <i>With each assault,
his game sense evolves.</i>

70
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,317
[Kojiro] <i>I know this.</i>

71
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,444
<i>This too.</i>

72
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,365
<i>I read these moves just a few seconds ago.</i>

73
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,909
[narrator] <i>The technique...</i>

74
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,871
{\an8}<i>Senju Musou!</i>

75
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,790
It's that same strategy.

76
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,209
He's predicting Poseidon's moves
at every opportunity.

77
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,211
This is crossing the line.

78
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,506
It's almost like
he can infiltrate the mind.

79
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,467
I'm curious, how deeply can he penetrate?

80
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,595
Fascinating creature.

00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,516

00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,942
<i>The more I try to chase after him,</i>

93
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,445

at the last second.</i>

94

- Huh?
- He switched!

103
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,997

[Heimdall] A sudden
critical turn of events.

But I'm ready to give it my all.

00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,700
<i>It's a shame...</i>

179
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,537
<i>I never wanted this struggle to end.</i>

180
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:57,294
[Brünnhilde] <i>For both of them, it was
the happiest moment of their entire lives.</i>

181
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:01,757
<i>A gift. The most meaningful
connection they would ever make.</i>

182
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,478
[Kojiro] <i>What a fight. Right, Musashi?</i>

183
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,313
Huh.

184
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,534
Hey, listen up, you ocean tyrant.

185
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,495
You mind if I ask you something?

186
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,749
Tell me...

187
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,962
have you ever lost yourself
to the swing of the blade at night,

188
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,299
<i>training until the sunrise?</i>

189
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,805
Or burst into tears of solemn gratitude,

190

<i>for someone who made you stronger
than you were before?</i>

191
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,397
In the heat of battle,

192
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,277
<i>have you admired your foe so much,
you'd die for them?</i>

193
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,740
<i>Hmm.</i>

194
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,742
{\an8}You know what?

195
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,160
{\an8}No.

196
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,538
My apologies.

197
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,920
You haven't gone through any of that.

198
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,592
Look at this blade.

199
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,553
See how it shines?

200
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:36,518
It stands for countless hopes and dreams
of all the fools who wield it.

201
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,107
All the time that you've been alive,

202
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,777
I bet you've never stood
for a single thing.

203
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,278
How unjust.

204
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,781
I won't lose
to a selfish bastard like you!

205
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,868
Ah!

206
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,122
Wait, what's happening?

207
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:02,836
The broken shards of Kojiro's weapon
are glowing brightly in his hands!

208
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,008
Ah, it's so shiny!

209
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,804
[grunting] But how is he...?
I can't believe it.

210
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,805
What, Papa?

211
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,723
He's... He's doing it.

212
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,600
Incredible.

Incredible! The blade fragments
have become two separate swords!

[crowd gasping]

227
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,334
Hm. Here we go.

228
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,089
Thank goodness,
sister Hrist is still alive.

229
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,466
It's a miracle.

230
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,969
I seriously thought
she was a goner back there.

231
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,512
What a relief.

232
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,267
But how? The weapon
was restored even after it broke.

233
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,686
[Brünnhilde] That's Hrist for you.

234
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,314
It's the power bestowed unto her name,

235
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,107
which has two meanings, remember?

236
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,109
"The trembling one."

237
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,903
And "The thundering one."

238
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,490
As the only Valkyrie
with dual personalities,

239
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,408
our sister is unequalled.

240
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,160
[chuckling]

241
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,955
Wow, you totally saw
this coming, didn't you?

242
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,957
That must have been
why you paired her with Kojiro

243
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,709
when you were planning everything out!

244
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,212
- Luck. Yes! [laughing maniacally]
- [screaming]

245
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,173
[Göll] <i>What does luck
have to do with anything?</i>

246
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,050
<i>Are you saying
this whole thing was a fluke?</i>

247
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,344
Hope they're ready!

248
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,054
[Göll] <i>Where did that come from?</i>

249
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,932
- Let's go.
<i>- Go where?</i>

250
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,894
Go, Kojiro Sasaki! Ha! I choose you!

251
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,187
<i>Uh...</i>

00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,356
[Kojiro chuckling]

253
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,817
Sorry, our quarrel's not over.

254
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,696
How about we put our hearts into this?
Show me what you're made of.

255
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,950
You lowly worm.

256

[both inhaling deeply]

257
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,636

00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:19,283
<i>It's only Kojiro, but still,
he looked just like Papa for some reason.</i>

261
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,870
Why though? Those are your movements
he's using out there, aren't they?

262
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,454
So how does he know them?

263
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,957
- Ha! Isn't it obvious?
- Huh?

264
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,085
He must have
kept fighting me in the afterlife,

265
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,421
at least a few thousand times.

266
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,507
<i>No, tens of thousands of times.</i>

267
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,927
<i>Challenging me again and again
till he got his fill.</i>

268
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,805
Burning everything he learned
into his body.

269
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,307
Wait, I don't get it.

270
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,351
Even if he's trained himself
to imitate your attacks properly,

271
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,021
is that gonna give him enough
of an advantage to defeat the gods?

272
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,733
He's doing much more
than swinging a couple of weapons.

273
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,111
- Pay attention, Iori.
- Huh?

Sword Saint Nobutsuna Kamiizumi!

Golly, I love it.

It is the essence
of our legacies that live on within him.

After years of discipline,

generations of master swordsmen now
bear witness as he pierces the heavens.

Oh dear, I've never
seen anything like this.

Master Poseidon, that's right,
