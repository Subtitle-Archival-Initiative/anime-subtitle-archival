the other a god.</i>

<i>Linked by one simple truth,</i>

8
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:06,251
<i>they both live the experience
of being the strongest,</i>

9
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,879
<i>slaughtering all opponents
with a single blow.</i>

10
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,384
<i>They've stepped foot onto
thousands of battlefields,</i>

11
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:18,221
<i>laying waste to tens of thousands
of their enemies.</i>

12
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:23,393
<i>But now, they clash with a foe,
who can withstand their attack.</i>

13
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,106
<i>Who shall be victorious?</i>

14
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,402
[Heimdall] It's an even match!
Neither can overpower the other.

15
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,656
Who could have predicted
such a shocking turn of events?

16
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,783
- [crowd cheering]
- You can do it, Lü Bu!

17
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,661
Amazing. He's holding his own.

18
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,498
[Zeus] A mere human
matching Thor's opening attack?

19
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,043
Rather impressive indeed.
I'll give the mortal that much.

20
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:54,173
They may have false hope of victory, as
they've yet to witness Thor's true power.

- [Brünnhilde gasping]
- What now?

25
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,903
[Heimdall] Whoa, look at that lightning!

26
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,530
He started this fight with his guard down.

27
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:29,959
But now he's wielding Mjölnir
in both hands!

28
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:36,758
What's this? Is he losing his balance
and falling backwards?

29
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,056
No! That's not it at all!

30
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,975
He's winding up for a devastating attack!

31
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,312
What kind of technique is that?
Is he nuts?

32
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,814
Hm. We'll see. Yes.

33
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:52,732
[Liu Bei] Indeed.

34
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,985
[Muninn] Thor's going to
wipe this mortal off the map!

35
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,862
I suppose he's bored of him already.

36
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,531
No, you've misjudged him.

37
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,034
I deduce that this is his way of showing

38
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,620
he accepts this human
as a worthy opponent.

39
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,704
[Muninn] Seriously?

40
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:10,750
[Huginn] He wouldn't even allow a human
to behold this move if he wasn't serious.

41
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,587
- Yes! The almighty hammer of Thor!

This is so tiresome.

What? You're on duty right now.

49
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:40,196
Captain, I didn't become a guardian angel
just to stand around.

50

I hate being on watch all day long.

51

[guard 2] He's right.
It's far too quiet around here.

52
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,081
[captain] You fools! If things are
at peace, we're doing our job right.

53
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,457
We're the guardian angel corps.

54
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,045
Pathetic. You've never even been
in a real fight. Don't get cocky.

55
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:56,963
Hm.

56
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,633
[guard 1] But still,
if there was a battle to be won,

57
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,052

58

Just as expected.

175
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,186
Hm?

176
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,146
- All right!
- Ah!

177
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,899
- There's no way.
- My.

even the skin of a god.</i>

184
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,550
Hmm.

185
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:27,431
- [gods murmuring]
- How? Was Thor really injured by a mortal?

186
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,518
No way. No way!

Facing off against a god.

249
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,125
My liege, Lü Bu, looks...

250
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,836
happier than ever!

251
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,507
Uh, well now. How unusual.

252
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,427
- Hmm.
- Lord Zeus, what's wrong?

253
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,346
Uh...

254
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,725
[shouting] I said, is there something
that's troubling you, Lord Zeus?

255
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:26,605
No. But if I think about it,
this should be impossible.

256
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,734
Are you wondering how a human like him,
can hold his own in a fight against a god?

257
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,860
Is that what it is?

258
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,403
Quit your yelling!

259
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:37,449
I'm not deaf yet, Hermes, there's
no need to shout in my ear like that,

260
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,909
you blithering idiot!

261
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,829
[sighing] Anyway, if you must know,

262
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,330
there is something.

263
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,874
Human weapons can't withstand Mjölnir.

264
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,878
They should be shattered to pieces
merely by coming into contact with it.

265
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,549
What we're seeing here is impossible.

266
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,343
There's not a single armament
on the mortal plane

267
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,387
that can do what this one is doing.

268
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,222
Hmm...

269
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,266
There's no way.

270
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,267
Unless...

271
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,409
[chuckling]

272
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,370
Ah! Is that how you're playing it?

273
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,164
Well done, Valkyrie.

274
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,916
I couldn't have rigged it better myself.

276
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:34,256
Uh, hey, Zeus is looking over at us
with a creepy smile on his face.

277
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,426
Yes. It seems he's finally noticed.

278
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,763
[narrator] <i>However, before Ragnarok began...</i>

279
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,688
[Göll] Lü Bu is first up for the humans?

280
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,441
You mean, the Lü Bu?

281
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,109
[Brünnhilde] Correct.

282
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:58,488
But, Brünnhilde,
that guy is way too dangerous.

283
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,283
He's the one who said that he was bored

284
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,452
after taking the lives
of countless others!

285
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,206
Listen, I know he's the strongest warrior
in the Three Kingdoms,

286
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:11,835
but is there even any possibility
he could defeat a god one-on-one?

287
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,838
Oh no. No, there isn't.

288
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:18,008
Ah! There isn't? Then why?

289
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,803
The source of each god's strength
is in their weapons.

290
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,390
Weapons which are all forged in heaven
to give them their absolute power.

291
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,394
Compared to what the gods produce,
mortal weapons are mere toys.

292

[whining]

293
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,898
The man who wields them matters not.

294
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:37,903
Göll, it's not possible for any human.
Their strength makes no difference.

295
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,906
There's no hope.

296
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,576
[crying] Why are we even trying?

297
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,663
[laughing] Your reaction's about right.

298
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,790
Anyone would assume
the mortals are doomed.

[sobbing]

300
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,877
But what if the humans
had a weapon of the gods.

301
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,128
[crying stops] Huh?

302
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,632
And, what if, blinded
by our choice of champion,

303
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,759
they simply failed to notice?

304
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,135
Does that mean...

305
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,846
Uh, isn't this...

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,820
Eldest sister, did you summon us?

308

We 11 Valkyries have answered your call,

00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,952
and by your wishes have assembled here.

310

What is it you need from us?

311
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,790
[Göll] Oh, our sisters.

312
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,337
This is the first time all 13 of us have
been gathered in one location, isn't it?

313
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,550
Brünnhilde, may I ask
what it is you're planning?

314
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,511
I don't understand.
How can the other Valkyries help?

315
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:46,888
Hm.

00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,606

All right, then. It's party time!
