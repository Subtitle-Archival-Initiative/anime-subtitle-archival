1
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:17,434
{\an8}In truth, the act of Völundr
merges human with Valkyrie.

2
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,478
They become as one,
united in both body and soul.

3
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,066
A Valkyrie doesn't merely transform
into a weapon through Völundr.

4
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,986
Her fate is bonded to her wielder's.

5
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,779
We fight together and...

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,406
we live or die together.

7
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,991
[sobbing]

8
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,244
Please don't cry, Göll.

9
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,329
Leif was prepared for this.

10
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,082
She knew how dangerous
her battle would be.

11
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,584
Every Valkyrie does.

12
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,713
A time may come when you too
must prepare to follow in our footsteps,

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,381
and put your life on the line.

14
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,385
I'll get my revenge on those
piece of shit gods.

15
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,890
Once I'm through with them, there won't
be enough left to scream for mercy.

16
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,892
[Hrist and Göll] Poseidon?

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,145
{\an8}Then they intend to break
our spirit as soon as possible.

18
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,272
It would be my honor.

19
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,190
<i>When did he...?</i>

20
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,986
What the heck's going on here?

21
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,030
I thought when a soul
was summoned to Ragnarok,

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,199
no matter how old
that person was when they died,

23
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,452
they would be summoned in their physical
prime, not as some crusty old geezer.

24
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,703
Isn't that how it works?

25
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,705
That is how it works.

26
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,332
And yet, this man claims to--

27
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,631
[whooshing]

28
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,800
Ugh.

29
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,179
Oh.

30
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,932
[Brünnhilde] <i>He's certainly not
what I expected.</i>

31
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>But still, right before our eyes,
he moved with the grace of a master.</i>

32
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,649
The man before us is the real thing.

33
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,901
Hm.

34
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,363
It's been 400 years since I was
called up to heaven,

35
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:58,159
Since then I have tirelessly worked
to hone my swordsmanship.

36
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,663
The nature of my Ganryu
has never stopped evolving.

37
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,665
[shimmering]

38
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,878
In other words, this old Kojiro
is a swordsman in his prime!

39
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,344
All right, sister.
You ready to offer yourself?

40
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,013
Of course.

41
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,736
[heavy metal music playing]

42
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:55,944
TYRANT OF THE OCEAN

43
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,613
[seagulls calling]

44
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,493
[waves crashing]

45
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,120
[crowd murmuring]

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,957
[male god 1] This new arrangement
is quite impressive.

47
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,460
[male god 2] The arena,
they did do quite a bit of remodeling.

48
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,462
A massive ocean.

49
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,298
Ocean... Then the next fighter has to be...

50
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,217
Really? Do you think it's possible?

51
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,721
[Heimdall] Well... [clearing throat]

52
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,265
Welcome to round three of Ragnarok,

53
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:29,852
the ultimate battle between man and maker.

54
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:33,606
With mankind struggling
under two losses in a row...

55
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,234
Oh! What a shame!

56
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:42,031
The blessed creators have forsaken their
children to suffer this harrowing ordeal.

57
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,908
But, hey, that's the gods for you.

58
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,494
They do as they please,
that's what defines them.

59
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,747
So let's bring out our next challenger.

60
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,710
Here comes god warrior three.
It's time to get wet!

61
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,573
If they say Zeus
is the father of the cosmos,

62
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,284
that makes this champion
the sultan of the seas,

63
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,536
the frosty tyrant of the ocean,

64
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,289
ruling the waves with an iron fist.

65
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,957
[gods cheering]

66
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,876
[male gods 1 and 2] I told you!

67
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,630
[Heimdall] Even other deities quake
at the thought of provoking his wrath.

68
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,049
<i>Everyone fears him!</i>

69
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,550
[gulping]

70
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,803
One of the three most powerful
Olympian immortals,

71
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,889
also known as Zeus Enalios,

72
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,267
he's the king of the aquatic,
the wonder of the waters...

73
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,897
{\an8}Poseidon!

74
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,282
Hm.

75
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,284
Circus of filth.

76
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,624
[ravens shuddering]

77
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,211
Huh. What an awful personality.

78
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,632
He's worse than you and the old man
when it comes to a lack of humor.

79
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:31,724
[gulping]

80
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,019
Even his fellow gods are terrified.

81
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,772
That makes sense.
He is Zeus's brother after all.

82
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:43,236
Pop quiz! Brought to you by the fool
who's challenging our maritime master.

83
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,239
Representing the humans
is this man, right here.

84
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,245
Who's the greatest swordsman of all time?

85
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,959
Is it Minamoto no Yoshitsune, who cut
down the Taira clan with his katana?

86
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,460
Nay!

87
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,296
Is it Nobutsuna Kamiizumi,

88
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:06,175
the Sengoku era hero
who founded the Shinkage-ryu,

89
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,845
and scared off Takeda Shingen?

90
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,762
Nay!

91
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,765
Perhaps it's Takayanagi Matashiro,

92
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,893
the silent samurai
of the Bakumatsu period,

93
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,521
whose skill was utterly unmatched?

94
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,438
Nay!

95
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,609
Let it be known.

96
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,029
The greatest one
is none other than this underdog.

97
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:34,203
But what makes this once defeated duelist
the undisputed king?

98
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,542
Is it his deadly finisher,
the <i>Tsubame Gaeshi?</i>

99
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:45,673
Or could it be that burning vendetta
against his longtime rival Musashi?

100
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,675
Nay!

101
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,260
Nay, I say!

102
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,182
Some think it's prose, some think
it's song, but everyone is wrong!

103
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,602
Even in the face of defeat, he advances!

104
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:02,607
Even after the throes of death,
he continues to evolve as a swordsman.

105
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,486
Even now, he lives in pursuit
of the perfect strike!

106
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,447
Behold, history's greatest loser...

107
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,449
THE STRONGEST LOSER IN HISTORY

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,619
SASA

109
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,621
KI

110
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,623
KO

111
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,625
JIRO

112
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,670
{\an8}KOJIRO SASAKI

113
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,631
{\an8}[crowd murmuring]

114
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,553
What? The fate of our existence
is in the hands of this fossil?

115
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,555
What? There's no way he'll win!

116
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,390
Is this supposed to be a sad joke?

117
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,352
[boy] I don't care.
Whatever they say, it's a load of bull.

118
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,103
[growling]

119
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,524
{\an8}How come he gets to fight for the people
when my papa beat him fair and square?

120
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,360
{\an8}He's the famous swordsman
Musashi Miyamoto.

121
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,946
{\an8}He's the hero who should be
named the greatest of all time!

122
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,448
{\an8}And you know, he also wrote
<i>The Book of Five Rings,</i>

123
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,326
{\an8}which is practically the bible
of tactical warfare.

124
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,663
{\an8}Don't you all agree?
I'm totally right, aren't I?

125
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,250
Hmm. Yes, I would say that checks out.

126
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,378
{\an8}Your father's the only one
who ever managed to take me down.

127
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,754
{\an8}- [man] Indeed.
- Hm?

128
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:11,509
{\an8}I would be fascinated
to hear Mr. Musashi's thoughts.

129
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,511
{\an8}MUSASHI MIYAMOTO
FOUNDER OF NITEN ICHI-RYU STYLE

130

[all murmuring]

131
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,770
[Göll] That's not good.

132
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,524
Humans are starting to get restless,
Brünnhilde! What should we do now?

133
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,360
We must believe in him.

134
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,321
And trust in his devotion
to mastering the blade.

135
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,531
Have faith.

136
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,868
[ringing]

137
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,791
[ringing]

138
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,464
[echoing]

139
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,225
What in the...?

140
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,644
What did that mortal just attempt to do?

141
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,730
This is quite the surprise.

142
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,736
Eh! This should
be thoroughly entertaining.

143
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,323
Humanity still has
a few tricks up its sleeves.

144
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,993
The ripples in the water have stopped.

145
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,120
Was it something the old-timer did?

146
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,581
Hmph! What's so cool about that?

147
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,876
It's just another one of Sasaki's
cheap gimmicks he's always pulling.

148
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,252
Isn't that right, Papa?

149
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,133
Uh...

150
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,595
Why did you do that?
Weren't those all your sacred teachings?

151
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,514
We won't be needing them anymore, son.

152
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,016
Huh?

153
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,018
[choking back tears]

154
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,020
[whimpering]

155
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,564
There it is.

156
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,360
He's found that state of enlightenment
every swordsman yearns to reach...

157
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,737
where no man can beat him.

158
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,030
NUMBER ONE UNDER THE SUN

159
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,534
Kojiro Sasaki is
the Number One Under the Sun!

160
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:07,541
[Heimdall] In this corner,
the ocean god Poseidon,

161
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,379
versus history's underdog, Kojiro Sasaki!

162
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,546
Hm.

163
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,049
THE THIRD BOUT IN THE FINAL BATTLE
BETWEEN GOD AND MAN

164
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,384
Fight!

165
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,569
[gulping]

166
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,572
The tension in the ring is too unbearable.

167
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,784
[humans murmuring impatiently]

168
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,578
Wait, how come neither of them
have budged yet?

169
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,877
Huh.

170
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,839
A false start can leave you
wide open to attack.

171
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,175
I believe that both fighters are
waiting for the other one to strike first.

172
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,343
- [laughing]
- Huh?

173
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,719
Excuse me.

174
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,012
You're sadly mistaken.

175
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,223
Poseidon wouldn't
concern himself with that.

176
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,224
Hm?

177
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:10,229
{\an8}If it's withing range, he'll decimate
any object without a speck of hesitation.

178
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,897
That's all there is to it.

179
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,128
Hmm.

180
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,801
He's sweating buckets
from standing in one place.

181
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,928
Can't expect to win with that strategy.

182
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,475
Ha! He's already all tired out
and with nothing to show for it.

183
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:51,520
Man, what a joke. At the end
of the day, he really is a loser.

184
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,483
That human is meticulous.

185
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,069
He has attempted to engage
in combat for several movements now.

186
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,987
Huh?

187
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,364
From inside his head. Mentally.

188
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,493
Sorry, I thought you were following along.

189
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,037
Uh, I was.

190
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,498
I... Yeah, right!

191
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,125
You meant he was
brainstorming simulations.

192
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,002
Clearly. He wasn't really attacking.

193
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,546
So... The point is I knew that.

194
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,256
[chuckling]

195
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,675
Hmm.

196
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,344
Well, that won't work.

197
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,931
[narrator] <i>The standoff had just begun.</i>

198
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:32,520
<i>But nobody knew that he had
already been slaughtered 18 times.</i>

199
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,898
What a pain.

200
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:41,237
No matter how you slice it.
I'm bound to get gored like a fish.

201
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,454
That blondie, he's not one to mess with.

202
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,457
Yes. I wonder if we stand a chance.

203
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,880
Ah, I guess Kojiro's officially
backed into a corner.

204
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,049
I think I'm beginning to see
why they call Poseidon

205
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,468
the most fearsome of the 12 Olympian gods.

206
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,972
That number's wrong. There's one more.

207
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,889
Hm?

208
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,686
Göll, listen carefully, there's
something important you should know.

209
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,479
Uh, what's the matter?

210
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,983
A long time ago,
when the gods were much younger,

211
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:23,445
<i>just as there were 13 Valkyries,
there were once 13 Olympians.</i>

212
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,283
[Göll] <i>Uh, what do you mean?
I don't remember hearing about that.</i>

213
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,370
One of the deities amongst
their ranks was murdered...

214
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,496
by one of their own.

215
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,250
The killer was Poseidon himself.

216
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,880
[gasping] Betrayed by a god.

217
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,214
That's horrible.

218
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,718
Wait, I have so many questions.
Tell me who the victim was.

219
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,178
The unfortunate Olympian...

220
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,723
was Adamas.

221
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,017
[gasping] I've heard that name.

222
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,437
I thought that was supposed to be
the name of Zeus's final form.

223
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,521
<i>It is.</i>

224
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,815
<i>But it is also the name of an heir,</i>

225
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,526
<i>who inherited the bloodline
of the almighty Cronus.</i>

226
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,697
A birthright he shared
with his brothers Zeus and Poseidon.

227
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,283
Adamas, dark lord of conquest.

228
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,371
<i>Once upon a faraway time...</i>

229
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,675
What's this talk about that little shit
being next in line?

230
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,969
Were those idiots even thinking?

231
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,390
He's a child. If they think
I'll accept it, they're wrong.

232
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,186
[Brünnhilde] <i>Previously,
Zeus and the Olympians worked together</i>

233
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,522
<i>to overthrow the Titans
during the Gigantomachy.</i>

234
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,944
<i>As the second eldest, Adamas disagreed
when they appointed Zeus to the throne.</i>

235
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,448
{\an8}<i>Incensed and spiteful,
he then staged a rebellion.</i>

236
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,619
<i>At his command, the Titans and the giants
were freed from imprisonment</i>

237
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,287
<i>in the underworld of Tartarus.</i>

238
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,625
<i>He subjugated Typhon, successfully
bending a frightening beast to his will,</i>

239
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,461
<i>and marched onward to Mount Olympus.</i>

240
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,004
{\an8}POSEIDON'S PALACE

241
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,464
{\an8}[Adamas] <i>The time has come!</i>

242
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,467
I have secured
the support of Zeus's council.

243
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,470
All members have pledged to follow me.

244
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,097
And there's more.

245
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,223
Thanks to Hermes,

246
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,978
several of the Olympians have promised to
provide me their unconditional allegiance.

247
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,729
You're the only one left.

248
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,982
We will execute Zeus. You and I.

249
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,942
Doesn't that sound enticing?

250
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,074
No sibling should be allowed
to rule over his elders.

251
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,368
That's a reasonable ask, right?

252
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,496
{\an8}Now then, swear your loyalty.

253
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,374
{\an8}I'm practically a mentor to you,
right, my brother?

254
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,005
Yes, a terribly pathetic one at that.

255
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,256
[gasping]

256
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,008
[growling]

257
00:16:55,597 --> 00:17:00,436
My apologies. I believe I misheard you.
You're a bit far.

258
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,189
Tell me, what did you say?

259
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,241
You'll need to speak louder.

260
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,745
I want to be sure that I understand you.

261
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,706
Say it once more.

262
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,584
{\an8}Go ahead. I'm listening.

263
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,423
{\an8}I expected this from Zeus.

264
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,591
But not you!

265
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,720
You should defer to me, yet you two
act like a pair of worthless brats!

266
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,390
I'm talking to you!

267
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,977
I outrank both of you imbeciles.
Show some respect!

268
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,109
A god needs no army.

269
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,113
Nor to resort to betrayal.

270
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,948
They need only themselves.

271
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,951
A god is complete.

272
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,456
We've always been
the embodiment of perfection.

273
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,920
But you, you've managed to defile
everything we represent.

274
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,589
Bastard!

275
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,803
How dare you try to make a fool out of me.

276
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,807
[whistling tunefully]

277
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,898
Don't mess with me!

278
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,195
[Adamas] <i>Since the day you were born,</i>

279
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,781
<i>you've always been
an arrogant little prick.</i>

280
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,492
<i>To this day...</i>

281
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,953
<i>not once...</i>

282
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:47,251
<i>Not one single time
did you acknowledge me.</i>

283
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,336
[whistling continues]

284
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,173
Look at me!

285
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:03,517
[Brünnhilde] <i>In the moment their eyes met,
Poseidon took his brother's life...</i>

286
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,814
<i>with one swift gesture.</i>

287
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,984
Why...

288
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,694
brother?

289
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,092
[Poseidon] Out of the 13 Olympian gods,

290
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,012
it seems one of us
was unsuited to the title.

291
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,055
Wouldn't you agree, Hermes?

292
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,020
[Hermes] <i>Someone has a sharp eye.</i>
[chuckles]

293
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,275
Yes, sir.

294
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,031
[Brünnhilde] <i>On that day forward, his name
was erased from the annals of history.</i>

295
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:04,494
{\an8}<i>As if the number of Olympian gods
had always been 12 from the dawn of time.</i>

296
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,873
You know, that does ring a bell.

297
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,042
The shock of Adamas's
attempted insurrection.

298
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,959
I remember.

299
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,837
There was a rumor back then
about how we had a dirty traitor

300
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,756
hiding among the 12 of us, wasn't there?

301
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,507
Oh, the rotten scoundrel was me.

302
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,468
Huh? Mmm.

303
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,931
So, it was you! You betrayed us?

304
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,309
The fallout from the ensuing war
would have torn the heavens apart.

305
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,479
Which is exactly why I found
the prospect too exciting to resist.

306
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,857
Huh? Sounds amazing!

307
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,275
A great idea!

308
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,110
A great big, bloody war!

309
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,196
Can't wait to get my muscles dirty.

310
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,243
Master Zeus was positively
beside himself with elation.

311
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,578
Gimme a break.

312
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,830
All these years and I never knew.

313
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,834
Adamas was a fighter, and to think
he was killed in one fell swoop.

314
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,586
You'd have to be a warlord yourself.

315
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,590
Actually, his precision for bloodshed
is hardly his most horrifying quality.

316
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,549
Hmm?

317
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,054
You see, as soon as Poseidon decreed
that Adamas never existed,

318
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,934
<i>it became canonized
as an undeniable reality.</i>

319
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,147
Whatever he says becomes the truth.

320
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,358
None are granted any room to object.

321
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,152
In my humble opinion,

322
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,487
that's what's scary.

323
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,906
Hmm. Sounds right.

324
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,992
That's what makes him
the force of nature he is.

325
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,412
A paragon. A king of a divine being.

326
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,380
Hm.

327
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,383
I get the feeling
I'm not enough of a threat for you.

328
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,095
So how do you suggest we speed this along?

329
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,972
Ah!

330
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,598
[both gasping]

331
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,686
[shrieking]

332
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,272
This is a tough situation.

333
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,858
[sighing]

334
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,447
But I'm not dying today.
