IN THE FINAL BATTLE BETWEEN GOD AND MAN

[chuckling]

5
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,038
The next round's mine.

6
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,707
{\an8}I just have to make sure
I keep a cool head.

7
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,381
If I let myself get fired up, I'll burn
my enemy before the match begins.

8
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,470
Hm?

9
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,807
[laughing]

10
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,892
What is it, old man?

11
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,687
You come all the way here
to cheer me on in person?

12
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,191
This second round is mine.

13
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,362
{\an8}What are you even talking about?

14
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,197
{\an8}I'm the one set for round two.

15
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,702
This second round is mine.

16
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,329
We agreed.

17
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,457
You said that you would
take the final round.

18
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,460
If you're asking to trade spots,
then forget it.

19
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,047
It is the first time
my blood has boiled like this in years.

20
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,968
[shouting] So get
your damn hand off of me!

21
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,264
This second round is mine.

22
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,434

[cackling]

25
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,940
Are you deaf or just senile?

26
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,402
I told you that I'm the one who's up n--
[grunting in pain]

27

[wheezing]

30
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,967
[chuckles] I understand.
You won't take no for an answer.

31
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:45,433
Well, if it's a fight you want, then let's
do this, old man. Right here and now.

32
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,312
[Hermes] <i>Oh, now this sounds like fun.</i>

33

[sighing]

36
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,673
All right, then. Guess I have no choice.

37
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,217
Round two is yours.

38
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,594
Age before beauty, as the saying goes.

39
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,348
Don't forget, you owe me one.

40
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,893
[laughing]

They're not fighting then? Too bad.</i>

[Heimdall] Now, it's the battle
you've all been waiting for.

50
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,481
Round two's a real dream match.

51
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,275
Zeus versus Adam!

52
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,862

[man 1] Adam!

[man 2] Kick his ass!

[man 3] Don't let him win!

58
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:34,292
Hey, you're going to do that
fancy little trick, aren't you?

59
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,171
Ho-ho! It's my favorite, you know.

60
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,468
<i>The trick where you
and a Valkyrie merge together.</i>

61
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,388
If you don't...

little man,

63
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,564
this won't take long.

Ah! Those glasses are...

68
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,381
Yeah, the Valkyrie best suited
to the father of mankind.

69
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,840
Our sister,

00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,718
she who was abandoned by the gods.

[humans gasping]

75
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,235
Adam, please give me your hand right now.

76
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,737
It's vital that we create
a bond between us.

77
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,991
With that complete,
I will then become a part of you.

Oh!

85
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,039
Is that Adam's chosen weapon?

86
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,129
[Heimdall in disbelief] Brass knuckles?

91
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,973
Hmm.

92
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,977
These are pretty sweet.

THE SECOND BOUT
ZEUS VS. ADAM

00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:10,323
All right. Let's get this rolling.

97
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,785
The ultimate battle between god and man, Ragnarok,

98
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,329
round two.

99
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,875
Representing the gods, Zeus.
Representing humanity, Adam.

100
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,754
<i>Let the battle begin!</i>

101
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,342
What a twist!

102
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,179
The Valkyries have used
their Divine Treasure Forge Völundr

103
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,973
to bestow Adam with some brass knuckles!

104
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:40,394
It would seem as though this man
really intends to fistfight Zeus,

105
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,938
the king of gods himself!

106
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:46,400
And my, what a man he is.
Truly a man among men.

107
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,902
[man 4] Hey, Dad!

108
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,655
{\an8}Give his wrinkled old face
a good punch for us!

ADAM'S FIRST SON - CAIN

Well now, you really picked a good one.

113
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,215
Hmm. It's a pretty solid weapon.

114
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,467
So, what's yours, chuckles?

115
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,677
Huh?

116
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,721
[gods clamoring]

117
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,432
[male god 3] Did that human
just call Zeus "chuckles"?

[whimpering]

119
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,108
Ho, ho, ho! Oh, me?

120
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:32,446
I want my fist to hear the cracking of
your bones as they shatter into bits, so...

121
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,824
My bare hand should suffice.

122
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,325
[twinkling]

123
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,120
Mmm. Okay, then.

124
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,039
But I think you're gonna regret that.

125
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,211
[laughing] Well, I'll give you
credit for your spirit!

126
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,965
All right, I'll go first!

127
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,301
And for the first strike...

128
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,018
Try this baby on for size!

130
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,237
Ho, ho, not bad.

131
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,742
That last attack was
Zeus's near-light-speed jab!

132
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,245
Adam just dodged it
without breaking a sweat!

133
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,748
[Zeus laughing]

134
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,334
- [humans cheering]
- Nice job, Papa!

135
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,002
Hell yeah!

136
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,007
Hm. Listen to them cheer.

137
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,177
All that noise
because he dodged father's punch.

138
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,762
A warm-up strike.

139
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,472
These humans are pathetic.

140
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,768
Tragically foolish creatures.
Wouldn't you agree, Hermes?

141
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,063
Yes, brother Ares.

142
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,065
I most certainly would.

143
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,943
Ho, ho, ho, ho! Pretty good.

144
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:57,114
No more pulling punches.
Time for the real beatdown!

[Zeus] Ha! Ha!

151
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,177
Hya!

152
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,181
{\an8}Meteor Jab!

153
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,403
[Heimdall] Zeus lets loose with a flurry
of jab, jab, jab, jab, jabs!

154
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,906
What an unbelievable flurry of fury!

155
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:44,829
But against all odds, Adam keeps dodging,
dodging, dodging and dodging again!

156
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,499
Zeus's fists keep
flying faster and faster!

157
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:53,629
But Adam rises to the occasion
and dodges every single strike.

0.00000001 SECONDS

159
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,764
{\an8}And next up is...

00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,733
Divine Axe!

161
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,198
Hm. Looks like
he's about to be cut clean in half.

162
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,036
[Zeus straining]

163
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:28,998
Huh?

164
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,545
[Heimdall] He... He dodged it!

165
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,298
Adam dodged Zeus's combo attack!

166
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,926
- [crowd screaming]
- What a spectacular, picture-perfect jump!

167
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,054
[chuckling]

168
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,183
Well done! Oh, you are good.

169
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,560
I'm very impressed.

170
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,686
But you know,

171
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,940
you cannot win this fight
simply by running away.

172
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,527
Oh, I'm keenly aware of that.

173
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,364
Huh?

174
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,534
So, how about... this.

<i>Could he be...?</i>

178
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,218
Oh-ho! Pretty good.

179
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,179

But, that's my...

187
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,916
[both] Huh?

188
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,919
[Zeus grunting]

189
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,923
Next up is...

190
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,424
Huh?

191
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,135
Divine Axe!

192

195
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,940
Oh, dear! That looked painful.

196

[groaning]

197
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,778
- [shimmering]
- Not bad.

198
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:28,742
[stammering] This has got to be
some sort of miracle!

199
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,162
Not only has Adam dodged Zeus's attacks,

200
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:36,750
he used those same attacks against him
and scored a direct hit!

201
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,460
- Yeah!
- Yeah, he did!

202
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,629
- [humans cheering wildly]
- That's the way!

203
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,756
[woman 1] You've got this, Adam!

204
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,759
[Göll] That... That was amazing!

205
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,304
I was kind of worried about him
when he showed up all naked,

206
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,847
but he's really strong.

207
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,225
I can't believe a human could use
a god's own attack against him.

208
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,771
- Oh, Göll, how easily we seem to forget.
- Huh?

209
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:02,901
The birth of Adam, the father of mankind,
that was the beginning.

210
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,487
The beginning?

211
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,281
Uh!

212
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,868
[narrator] <i>"So God
created man in his own image."</i>

213
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:17,124
<i>The Old Testament, Genesis 1:27.</i>

214
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:23,047
Yes, mankind was created
in the image of god.

215
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,551
In other words,
Adam is a copy of the divine.

216
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,805
And so, he is able to flawlessly replicate

217
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,017
any technique he sees a god put to use.

218
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:41,231
So if the gods try to shit on him,
he can smear it on their smug faces!

219
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,026
That is Adam's greatest power!

220
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,029
<i>[narrator] Correct. And the power's name</i>

221
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,531
<i>is Divine Reflection.</i>

[Zeus chuckling]

223
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,287
Well done. Well done.

224
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,374
- I haven't had this much fun...
- [bones cracking]

225
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,793
...in at least ten millennia.

226
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,838
But, no more playing around.

227
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,759
Ah, those bizarre stomping movements.

228
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,886
If he's getting his legs limbered up,

229
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,681
does he plan to end this with a kick?

230
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,605
[shimmering]

231
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,656
Dodge this!

232
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,703
Oh!

[exciting rock music playing]

237
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:07,025
[Heimdall] He's... He's down!

238
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:13,198
Against all odds, against all logic,
Zeus the almighty has been taken down!

239

[humans cheering]

240
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,292
Once more, Adam has perfectly replicated
one of Zeus's signature attacks!

241
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,670
Shh. Who the hell
does that human think he is?

242
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,796
Huh?

243
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,799

244
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,759

00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,110
[Adam sighing]

252
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,948
To be honest with you,
I didn't want to have to resort to this.

253
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,453
But this is a fight after all.

254
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:03,207

Huh? "Gramps"?

261
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,231
I'm so happy!

262
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,483
Just so happy.

263
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,527
So happy, I...

264
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,947
So happy, I can't...

265

[squealing] No matter what he says,
that guy is definitely not happy!

He's so mad, it's just plain scary.
[sobbing]

269

All right. Let's see
if you can copy this one.
