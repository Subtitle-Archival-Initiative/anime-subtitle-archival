15
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:31,967
The year is 2016 A.D.

16
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,062
The thing that people had lost

17
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,523
In other words, the instrumentality
of souls was still ongoing

18
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,575
However, there is far too little time left
to make mention of it all

19
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,387
Therefore, now, we will take
the boy named Shinji lkari

20
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,245
and tell the story of the
instrumentality of his soul

21
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,591
In the Case of Shiniji lkari

22
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:43,386
Fear

23
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,137
Of ceasing to exist.

24
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,241
But considering the way I am,
I don't think I need to exist.

25
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,309
Why not?

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,560
Because I'm not needed.

27
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,214
I'm an unwanted child after all.

28
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,083
No one cares about what happens to me!

29
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,119
You're running away by thinking
that it doesn't matter.

30
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,155
You're afraid of failure, aren't you?

31
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,758
You're afraid that people won't
love you, aren't you?

32
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,094
You're afraid of seeing how
weak you are, aren't you?

33
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,529
But that's exactly how you are too, Miss Misato!

34
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,432
That's right, we're all the same.

35
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,267
There's a piece of our hearts missing.

36
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,802
That's what we're afraid of.

37
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,670
It makes us insecure.

38
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,373
That's why we're all trying
to become one right now.

39
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,541
We're trying to make up for it with each other.

40
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,810
That is the Instrumentality Project.

41
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,647
Humans cannot live unless they are in groups.

42
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,488
Humans cannot live alone.

43
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,351
Even though there is only one of you.

44
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,186
That's why you suffer.

45
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,787
That's why you feel lonely.

46
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,025
That's why you want to meld your body
and soul with someone else's.

47
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,826
You want to become one.

48
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,796
Humans are made of weak and fragile stuff.

49
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:47,466
The body and soul are also made
of weak and fragile stuff.

50
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,469
That is why we must complement
one another through instrumentality.

51
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,140
"“Why?"

52
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,440
Because we cannot live otherwise.

53
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,371
"Really?"

54
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,278
What are you alive for?

55
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,239
"I don't know"

56
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,904
Maybe I'm living because
I want to figure that out.

57
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,384
Who are you living for?

58
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,686
For myself, of course.

59
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,388
For myself, I think.

60
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,409
"Really?"

61
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,259
Are you happy to be alive?

62
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,660
I don't know.

63
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,429
Are you happy to be alive?

64
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,497
Of course, I'm happy!

65
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,048
Are you happy to be alive?

66
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,968
I only want to do what I enjoy doing.

67
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,608
Do you hate feeling lonely?

68
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,173
1 don't like it.

69
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,375
Do you hate suffering?

70
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,143
1 don't like it.

71
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,845
Is that why you run away?

72
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,846
That's right.

73
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,682
What's wrong with running away
from the things you don't like?!

74
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,216
Exit

75
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,049
Exit
I shouldn't run away!

76
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,650
I shouldn't run away!

77
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,820
Why mustn't you run away?

78
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,555
Because running away is painful.

79
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,890
Even though you're running away
from something painful?

80
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,559
It was painful.

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,829
If you know it's going to be painful,
then what does it matter?

82
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,410
Yes, you can run away if it's painful.

83
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,786
If you really hate it, you can run away.

84
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,180
But I don't want tol I don't want
to run away anymore!

85
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,742
That's right, it's wrong to run away.

86
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,993
Play
Messages
That's because you feel that it's
more painful to just run away.

87
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,482
Because you learned how painful
it is to run away.

88
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,353
That's why you don't want to run away, isn't it?

89
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:15,186
Because if I run away, no one will respect me.

90
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,789
Don't forsake me.

91
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,750
Please, don't forsake mel

92
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:22,194
Quietly obeying what other
people tell him to do,

93
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,330
maybe that's his survival mechanism.

94
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,967
That's right! Because if I don't,
I'll be abandoned again.

95
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,536
You're afraid of being hurt, aren't you?

96
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,805
It's just what you've made
yourself believe, isn't it?

97
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,026
Shinji, you're not the only one who's hurting.

98
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,878
You're not the only one
goin' through tough times.

99
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,047
You only believe that,
because it's easier to think that.

100
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,884
Shut up! That has nothing to do with this!

101
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,319
No one cares what happens to me!

102
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,556
You're always so quick to
dismiss your self-worth.

103
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,792
Because I have nothing.

104
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,403
There you go again, making yourself
believe that you're worthless!

105
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:59,598
Because if you believe that and
do nothing, you won't be hurt.

106
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,699
You sustain your identity with the praise
you receive from people.

107
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,583
No one will accept me.

108
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,440
You've made yourself believe that.

109
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,310
That's why I have to pilot the Eva.

110
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,031
You've made yourself believe that
you are worthless to start with.

111
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,950
That's what I have to do!

112
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,518
That's not true.

113
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,949
You've probably just made
yourself believe that.

114
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,566
No, I am worthless.

115
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,792
I have nothing to be proud of.

116
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,928
That's why you pilot the Eva.

117
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,388
By piloting the Eva, I can be me.

118
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,109
By piloting the Eva, I can be me.

119
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,646
I had nothing before I started piloting the Eva.

120
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,199
I'm allowed to be here, because I pilot the Eva.

121
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,619
I have nothing else.

122
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,152
Because I have nothing else.

123
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,716
I have nothing, nothing at all.

124
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,857
"That makes my life worth something"

125
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,419
Nothing.

126
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,730
"..s0"

127
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,142
I hate myself.

128
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,642
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you so much!

129
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,102
Man, I just hate you!

130
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,166
I hate who you are.

131
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,702
I'm sorry, I hate you.

132
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,703
I hate you.

133
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,804
I do hate you.

134
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,105
I hate you.

135
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,207
I hate who you are.

136
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,878
I hate the person you are.

137
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,901
I just hate you!

138
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,818
See? Everyone thinks so.

I know that's what they think.

141
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:24,717
I know that's what they think.

142
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,448
You're just making yourself believe that.

143
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,034
No! Because I hate myself!

144
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,993
So, you've made yourself believe that
everyone else thinks so too.

145
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,662
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you so much!

146
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,043
I hate you!

147
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,999
But they still praise me.

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,930
They'll praise me if I pilot the Eva.

149
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,936
People praised me.

150
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:44,867
"That's why I'm happy"

151
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,705
People praised me.

152
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,846
"But it doesn't make me happy"

153
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,722
Which way do you really feel?

154
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,312
I don't know.

155
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,848
No, both ways are real.

156
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,083
And that's why you pilot the Eva, isn't it?

157
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,286
Because right now, the Eva is all I have.

158
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,388
Because otherwise, you can't
maintain your identity.

159
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,058
It's true, Eva Unit 01 is a part of who you are.

160
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,929
But if you keep clinging to the Eva,
the Eva itself will become you.

161
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,932
The Eva itself will become all you are.

162
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,535
The real you will cease to exist.

163
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,803
I don't care!

164
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,703
I never had anything to begin with anyway!

165
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,742
Even the cello lessons I used to take
all came to nothing.

166
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,345
That's because you never took the
initiative to make something of it!

167
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,814
But I can pilot the Eva now!

168
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,151
And eventually, you won't be able
to do anything without the Eva.

169
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,142
Like me.

170
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,676
"Why do you pilot the Eva?"

171
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,921
Because that is all I have.

00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,636
A depressing mood...

175
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,135
It's like the mood I'min.

176
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,603
1 don't like it.

00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,005
Sunset...

178
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,773
Vanishing life...

179
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,375
My wish...

180
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,426
1 don't like it.

181
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,154
Morning...

182
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,347
The start of today...

183
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,098
The start of an unpleasant day...

184
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,193
1 don't like it.

185
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,079
The blue sky...

186
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,588
Something warm...

187
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,223
Something I'm not used to...

188
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,558
Something frightening...

189
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,993
Something that's not needed...

190
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:14,864
1 don't like it.

191
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,525
Everyonel! I just hate everyone!

192
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,231
What do you desire?

193
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,082
"Are you afraid of being insecure?"

194
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,867
What do you want?

195
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:22,738
"Do you want peace of mind?"

196
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,703
What do you seek?

197
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,344
"Don't hate me!"

198
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,282
Don't hate me!

199
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:28,807
What I'm afraid of is...

200
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,478
Rejection

201
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,043
What I want is...

202
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,034
To connect and to be recognized

203
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,446
Is it okay if I stick around?

204
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,215
Is it okay if I stay here?

205
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,765
Do you love me?

206
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,231
"Do you love"

207
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,412
"your mother?"

208
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,389
Do you want to go to your mom?

209
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,757
No, I don't want to.

210
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,226
Aren't you going to go to your father?

211
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,396
No, I don't want to.

212
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:49,661
Why not?

213
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,622
Because I'm afraid

214
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,766
Because I'm afraid he'll hate me.

215
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,335
Because I might cease to be me.

216
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,156
"goP"

217
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:58,971
What do you desire?

218
00:08:58,972 --> 00:08:59,962
A resolution to the insecurity

219
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,807
What do you seek?

220
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:02,738
A resolution to the loneliness

221
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,992
You're not happy, are you?

222
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,322
I want something before that.

223
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,449
 want to be worth something.

224
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,786
Worth enough so no one will abandon me,
so they'll care about me.

225
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:14,957
"l want to be worth something"

226
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,825
Only you can find your own worth.

227
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,086
That's why you pilot the Eva

228
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,862
I'm worthless.

229
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,031
My life isn't worth enough to live.

230
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,534
Then, what are you?

231
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,795
Then, what am I?

232
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,240
What am [?!

233
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:36,975
This is...

234
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,077
Mel!

235
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,345
It's the form of me that I show to others.

236
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,947
It's the symbol that is me.

237
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,282
So is this, and this and this!

238
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:43,833
Shinji lkari
So is this, and this and this!

239
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,885
They're all just things that represent me.

240
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,376
They're all merely what other people
.
recognize as me.

241
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,630
Then, what am I?

242
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,635
"Where do I exist?"

243
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,594
Is this me?

244
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,862
The real me?

245
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,130
The false me?

246
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,898
You are you.

247
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,367
The only thing is, there's a distinct
difference between that

248
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,836
and the actual scope of who you are.

249
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,003
That’s right.

250
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,238
My clothes...

251
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,406
My shoes...

252
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,487
My room...

253
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,176
These things are a part of me.

254
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,757
The things that are linked together
through your consciousness.

255
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,667
The thing that I feel to be me, is me.

256
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,510
I am nothing more than myself then.

257
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,810
But I don't understand me.

258
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,998
Where do I exist?

259
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,951
What am I?

260
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,915
What am [?!

261
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,958
That is why I wish for my soul
to be closed off

262
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,017
No one understands anything about me!

263
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,703
What are you, stupid?! Of course,
no one understands!

264
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,266
No one could possibly understand
anything about you!

265
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,319
The only person who can sympathize
with you and understand you, is you.

266
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,536
So, be good to yourself.

267
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:53,986
But there's no me! I don't understand!

268
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,521
There's no way I can be good to that!

269
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,572
"You're insecure"

270
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,224
In the end, you're insecure.

271
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,893
The way you are now...

272
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,764
The people around you now...

273
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,459
The environment that surrounds you now...

274
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,089
None of these things will last forever.

275
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,204
Time will keep passing for you.

276
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,815
Your world is made up of continual change.

277
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,577
But above all, it's all up to your heart and mind.

278
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,512
You can change the world at any time.

279
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,080
What is this?

280
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,849
A world with nothing in it?

281
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,751
A world with nobody in it?

282
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,619
A world of freedom.

283
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,288
Freedom?

284
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,859
It's a world of freedom, where there's
nothing restricting you.

285
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,827
This is freedom?

286
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,578
Yes, a world of freedom.

287
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,128
But in exchange, there's nothing.

288
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,568
As long as I don't think of anything?

289
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,304
Yes, as long as you don't think of anything.

290
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,175
But I don't know what I should do.

291
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,209
You're insecure, aren't you?

292
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,211
You don't have an image of yourself, do you?

293
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,979
It's all just too vague.

294
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,148
A world where there is nothing
solid enough to grab onto...

295
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,169
That is freedom

296
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,185
A world you can do anything you want with...

297
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,754
But you're insecure, aren't you?

298
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,624
Do you not know what you should do?

299
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,259
What should I do?

300
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,860
I will give you a restriction.

301
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,296
There, now you have heaven and earth.

302
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,533
But now, you've lost one aspect of your freedom.

303
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,135
You must stand on the ground.

304
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,571
But you feel more secure.

305
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,274
Because a small weight has been
lifted from your mind.

306
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,775
And you try walking.

307
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,877
That is of your own will.

308
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,146
This is my will?

309
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,984
A ground exists in this world,
and that is the world you live in.

310
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,953
But you can move around in it freely.

311
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,090
If you wanted to, you could even change
the position of the world.

312
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:42,127
And the position of the world
never stays still either.

313
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,408
It changes, along with the passage of time.

314
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,274
You yourself can change as well.

315
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:52,541
Because what shapes you is your own mind
and the world around you.

316
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,790
For, this is your world.

317
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,544
It's the form of reality that you perceive.

318
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,564
"That is reality"

319
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,282
This is...

320
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,183
A space with nothing in it.

321
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,219
A world with nothing in it.

322
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,270
A world that has nothing else in it, except me.

323
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,059
I'm losing my grasp on who I am.

324
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,675
I feel like I'm disappearing.

325
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,275
The existence that is me is vanishing.

326
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,464
"“Why?"

327
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,466
Because you are the only one here.

328
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,235
Because I'm the only one?

329
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,271
Because without the existence of
things other than yourself,

330
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,273
you cannot know your own shape.

331
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,374
My own shape?

332
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,575
"My image of me?"

333
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,120
Yes, you know your own shape through
seeing how other people are shaped.

334
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,216
By looking at the barrier between you
and other people,

335
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,652
you visualize your own shape.

336
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,693
You cannot see yourself unless
there are other people.

337
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,964
I can exist because there are
other people around!

338
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,247
If I'm alone, I'll always be alone,
no matter how far I go with it!

339
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,097
All the world would just be mel

340
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,435
By recognizing the differences
between yourself and others,

341
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,166
you shape who you are.

342
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,873
The very first other person is your mother.

343
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:05,210
Your mother is a person separate from you.

344
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,701
Right, I'm me.

345
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:11,817
But it's also certain that the other people
shape my mind as well!

346
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,086
That's right, Shinji Ikari.

347
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,516
Did you finally figure that out, stupid Shinji?!

348
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,202
So, you're finally awake, stupid Shiniji.

349
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,728
Oh, it's just you, Asuka.

350
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,471
JUST me?! I come over here every morning

351
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,040
to make sure that YOU aren't late to school,

352
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,377
and those are the words of gratitude
you offer to your childhood friend?!

353
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,838
Yeah, thanks.

354
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,687
So let me sleep for a little longer.

355
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,852
What kind of spoiled attitude is that?!

356
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,843
Darn it, hurry up and get up!

357
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,395
Pervert! Idiot! Letch! I can't believe you!

358
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,766
I can't help it! It's morning!

359
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,007
Oh, that Shinji.

360
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,165
Asuka's being so nice, coming to get him.
He's just hopeless.

361
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,341
Yes, Dear.

362
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,972
You too! Stop burying your nose in that
newspaper and get ready to go.

363
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,313
Yes, Dear.

364
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,123
Honestly, a grown man and you're
no different than Shiniji.

365
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,886
Are you all ready to go?

366
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,176
Yes, any time!

367
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,290
I'm the one who gets scolded by
Professor Fuyutsuki

368
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,459
when we're late to meetings, you know.

369
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,528
You're just that popular.

370
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,249
Don't be silly! Please hurry up and get dressed!

371
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,199
Yes, Dear.

372
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,900
South Pole Showa Base
Opening lts Doors to Visitors
First African-American
Female President

373
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,631
South Pole Showa Base
Opening lts Doors to Visitors
First African-American

I know, Yui.

374
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,906
Come on, hurry up!

375
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:43,308
Yeah, I know!

376
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,776
You're such a pain, Asukal

377
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,007
What did you say?!

378
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,698
Well, Mrs. lkari, see you later!

379
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,951
See you later.

380
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,322
Okay, I'll see you later!

381
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,557
Come on, Dear! When are you going
to put that newspaper down?!

382
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,578
Yes, I know, Yui.

383
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,702
I heard there's a transfer student
coming in today.

384
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:15,507
Well, by next year, they'll have transferred
the capital here after all.

385
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,275
There's going to be more
and more people coming.

386
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,845
That's true. I wonder what she's like?

387
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,426
I hope she's cute.

388
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,651
Oh, I'm late! I'm late!

389
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,692
I1t'd be pretty bad if I'm late
on my first day, right?!

390
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,005
Sorry about that! I was seriously in a hurry!

391
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,545
Really sorry about that!

392
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,545
What are you, stupid?

393
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,296
What are you, stupid?
What?! So, did you see them?
That girl's panties?

394
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,066
I didn't really see them, just a little flash.

395
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,798
You sure are a lucky bastard!
And the day's just started!

396
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,560
What's the big idea, Class Rep?!

397
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,895
And what about you, Suzuhara?!

398
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,931
What kind of stupid talk is this
to start the morning off with?!

399
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,534
Come on, hurry up and go change
the water in the flower vase!

400
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,768
It's your week, isn't it?!

401
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,537
Man, you're such a pain!

402
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,647
What did you say?!

403
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,142
He's the type who's going to
end up getting whipped.

404
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,373
So are you.

405
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,313
Why am I the type that's going
to end up getting whipped?

406
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,916
What? I call it like I see it.

407
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:31,950
Why?!

408
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,485
Just look at yourself!

409
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,121
That's just because you never shut up!

410
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:36,388
Man, it's so peaceful.
That's just because you never shut up!

411
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,438
Man, it's so peaceful.
Oh, be quiet, stupid Shinji!

412
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,935
Hey, it's Miss Misato!

413
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,625
Miss Misato's just awesome!

414
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,343
What's with that stupid trio?! They're so dumb!

415
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,881
Rise! Bow!

416
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,667
Be seated!

417
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,256
Rejoice, boys!

418
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,597
Let me introduce the much-rumored
transfer student!

419
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,350
I'm Rei Ayanami, nice to meet you.

420
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,966
You! You're the panty-peeker
from this morning!

421
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,301
Hey! That’s not fair!

422
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,303
You're the one who flashed them at Shinji!

423
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,606
Who are you?! Leaping to his defense like that?!

424
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,277
What are you, an item?!

425
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:30,842
Pull Back

426
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,333
Pull Back
We're just childhood friends! You annoying brat!

427
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,515
Hey, we're in the middle of class!
Please be quiet!

428
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,556
Come on, this sounds like fun.
I want to know too.

429
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,764
Please continue.

430
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,665
I get it, this is also a possible world.

431
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,733
One possibility that's in me.

432
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,202
The me right now is not exactly who I am.

433
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,043
All sorts of me's are possible.

434
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,753
That's right. A me that's not
an Eva pilot is possible too.

435
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:09,948
When you think of it that way,
this world of reality isn't so bad.

436
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,684
The world of reality might not be so bad.

437
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,175
But I hate myself.

438
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,923
It's you that perceives reality
as bad and unpleasant.

439
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,327
It's you who's mistaken reality for the truth.

440
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,263
Your perspective on reality and the
importance you place on reality,

441
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,933
the slightest difference in these things will
greatly change the world inside your mind.

442
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,436
There are as many truths as there are people.

443
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,339
But there is only one truth for you.

444
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,241
One made from your narrow
perception of the world

445
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:39,110
and from information that was
altered to protect yourself,

446
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,845
a warped truth.

447
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,549
Well, one person's perception of the world's
bound to be tiny anyway.

448
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:49,521
But people only have that tiny ruler
to measure their surroundings with.

449
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:53,152
And you only try to see things through
the truths that other people have given you.

450
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,294
On sunny days, you feel good.

451
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,229
On rainy days, you feel down.

452
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,700
Once you've been taught that, you make yourself
believe that's how you should feel.

453
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,436
Even though pleasant things
can happen on rainy days too.

454
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,505
It's a delicate thing that can be
completely transformed

455
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,374
just by how you perceive something.

456
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,305
The truth within people, that is.

457
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,213
That's about how solid the truth is for humans.

458
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,964
Though, that's what also makes people
seek a deeper truth.

459
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,118
You are merely not used to
being loved by other people.

460
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:26,842
So there's no need for you to constantly care
about what other people think of you.

461
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:31,362
But doesn't everybody hate me?

462
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,931
What are you, stupid?!

463
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,652
You're just making yourself
believe that, that's all!

464
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,272
But I hate myself.

465
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:44,922
Anyone who hates himself can't
come to love and trust others.

466
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:50,871
I'm a gutless, hypocritical, wimpy coward.

467
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,872
See? If you understand yourself,
you can be kind.

468
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,346
I hate myself.

469
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,552
But maybe I can learn to love myself.

470
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,664
Maybe it's okay for me to be here!

471
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,945
That's right! I'm me, nothing more, nothing less!

472
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,103
I'm me.

473
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:13,915
I want to be me!

474
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,187
 want to be herel

475
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,429
And it's okay for me to be here!

476
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:34,926
Congratulations!

477
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,294
Congratulations!

478
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,395
Congratulations!

479
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,730
Congratulations!

480
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,831
Congratulations!

481
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:40,799
Congratulations!

482
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,167
Congrats!

483
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:43,017
Congratulations!

484
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,204
Congratulations!

485
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,472
Congratulations!

486
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,706
Congratulations!

487
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:49,974
Congratulations!

488
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,115
Congratulations!

489
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,878
Thank you.

490
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,139
To my father, thank you.

491
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,641
To my mother, farewell.

492
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,582
And to all the children...

493
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,664
Congratulations!
