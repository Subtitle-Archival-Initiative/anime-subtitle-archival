1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:06,502
Just like the cruel angel

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:14,334
Young boy, become a legend

3
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:28,357
Even though the untested breeze
taps at the door to your heart

4
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:36,747
You just look solely at me and smile

5
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:43,105
So intent on seeking out that gentle touch

6
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:51,228
Such innocent eyes, still ignorant
of their destiny

7
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:58,263
But someday, you are sure to realize
that upon your back

8
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:06,173
You have the wings with which to fly
towards the distant future

9
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:11,369
The cruel angel's thesis

10
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,107
Soon, you will take flight from the windowsill

11
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,878
With your torrent of ardent pathos

12
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,582
If you are to betray our memories

13
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:26,217
You, who embrace these heavens and shine

14
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,499
Young boy, become a legend

15
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,377
Reason for existing, raison d'étre

16
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,059
The reason why one is allowed to be here

17
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,788
In the Case of Shiniji lkari

18
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,720
The boy wished for death of his own will

19
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,223
The boy granted his wish

20
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,814
The final Angel is gone

21
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,076
But Shinji Ikari is tormented

22
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,638
Why did you kill him?

23
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,295
Why did you kill him?

24
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,331
Why did you kill him?

25
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,344
Why did you kill him?

26
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,367
Why did you kill him?

27
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,227
Because I had no choice!

28
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,368
Why did you kill him?

29
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,565
Because Kaworu was... He was an Angel!

30
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,556
Even though he was also human?

31
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,902
No! An Angel! He was our enemy!

32
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:17,923
Even though he was human, like you?

33
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,875
No! No! You're wrong!

34
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,376
Even though he was a person, just like me?

35
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,912
No! He was an Angel!

36
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,547
That's why you killed him?

37
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,951
That's right! If I hadn't, we would've died!

38
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,619
Everyone would have been killed!

39
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,887
That's why you killed him?

40
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,756
I didn't do it because I wanted to!

41
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,157
I had no choice.

42
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,275
That's why you killed him

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,926
Help me...

44
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:41,777
That's why you killed him

45
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:42,964
Help me.

46
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:43,920
That's why you killed him

47
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:44,907
Help mel

48
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,375
That's why you killed him

49
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,853
Someone, help me!

50
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,095
That's why you killed him

51
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,852
Please, someone just help me!

52
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:00,513
That's right, Kaworu was the one
who should have survived.

53
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,495
He was a much better person than I am.

54
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,087
Kaworu should have been the one to survive.

55
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,221
You're wrong.

56
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,622
Only those who have the will
to live get to survive.

57
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,260
He wished to die.

58
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,041
He abandoned his will to live,
clinging instead to a false hope.

59
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,466
You did nothing wrong, Shinji.

60
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,287
Is that true?

61
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,148
Uncertainty

62
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,503
Is this really how it should be?

63
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:24,914
Haunting Uncertainty

64
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,340
I don't know. What should I do?

65
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,608
What am I supposed to do?!

66
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,479
What are you afraid of?

67
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,744
Afraid of?

68
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:32,475
What are you afraid of?

69
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,679
Me?

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,440
What are you afraid of?

71
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:35,915
Being hated.

72
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:36,555
What are you afraid of?

73
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,416
By whom?

74
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,017
What are you afraid of?

75
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:38,751
By whom?

76
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:39,162
What are you afraid of?

77
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,421
By Father!

78
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,672
Father abandoned me! He hated me!

79
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,427
What will I do if people hate me?

80
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,858
What should I do?

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,580
Where am I?

82
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,703
Where am I supposed to go?

83
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,005
I can't see anything.  don't know what's what.

84
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,558
Miss Misato?

85
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,463
Miss Misato?!

86
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,964
Hey, where did you go, Miss Misato?

87
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,122
Hey, where am I supposed to go now?

88
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,766
Miss Misato! Asuka! Ayanami!

89
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,168
Toji! Kensuke! Miss Ritsuko!

90
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,603
Mr. Kaji!

91
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,714
Father!

92
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,679
Mother...

93
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,777
Someone tell me.

94
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,416
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

95
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,804
Evangelion Unit O1...

96
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,536
So, do I ultimately have no choice
but to pilot it?

97
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,957
Even after killing someone I loved?

98
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,693
Are you saying I'm supposed to listen
to my father and everyone else,

99
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,629
and get back in this thing to fight?!

100
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,063
Mother!

101
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,166
Say something! Answer me!

102
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,186
Why do you pilot the Eva?

103
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,329
Because everyone tells me to pilot it.

104
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,654
That's why you pilot the Eva?

105
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:10,176
It's... It's for the good of everybody,
so why does it matter?!

106
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,927
So, you pilot the Eva for everybody,
for others?

107
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,565
That's right. It's a good thing!

108
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,349
It's a very good thing!

109
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,570
If I pilot it, everyone praises me!
They treat me well!

110
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,721
That's a lie!

111
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,857
What are you, stupid?!

112
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,908
In the end, you're just doing it for yourself!

113
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,845
And there you go, making up excuses
for yourself again!

114
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,432
I am?

115
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,036
Thinking that you're working hard
for the sake of others!

116
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,471
That in and of itself is the easy way to live!

117
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,642
Really?

118
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,591
In other words, you're lonely, Shinji.

119
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,778
Really?

120
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,847
That's just being dependent!

121
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,688
It's nothing but a symbiotic relationship!

122
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,680
You might be right.

123
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,069
You just want people to need you!

124
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,534
You might be right.

125
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:03,996
All you do is wait, wanting people
to give you happiness!

126
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,427
False happiness!

127
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,809
But that goes for you too.

128
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,635
The Second Character

129
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,826
In the Case of Asuka Langley Sohryu

130
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,546
I don't remember getting on,
but I'm back in the Eva again.

131
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,977
 was put back in.

132
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,603
It's not going to move anyway, piece of junk.

133
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,170
No, I'm the piece of junk.

134
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,894
They don't need me! No one needs me!

135
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,895
No one needs a pilot who can't control her Eval

136
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,969
So, you're seeking to find yourself in others.

137
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,490
Shut up!

138
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,401
Separation Anxiety

139
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,140
You're afraid of becoming alone, aren't you?

140
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:48,691
Separation Anxiety

141
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,811
Because you disappear along with the people
around you. That's why you're afraid, aren't you?

142
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,222
Separation Anxiety

143
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,681
That's why you pilot the Eva!

144
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:56,092
Attachment Behavior

145
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,049
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

146
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:57,816
Attachment Behavior
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

147
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:58,927
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

148
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,979
I don't want to hear that from a puppet like you!

149
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,325
The Third Character

150
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,833
In the Case of Rei Ayanami

151
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,393
Who am 1?7

152
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,094
Rei Ayanami.

153
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,562
Who are you?

154
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,823
Rei Ayanami

155
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,096
You're also Rei Ayanami?

156
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,411
Yes, I am the thing that is called Rei Ayanami.

157
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,731
We are all things that are called Rei Ayanami.

158
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,405
How can we all be me?

159
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,650
Because everybody calls us Rei Ayanami.

160
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,861
Why do you possess a false heart and body?

161
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,602
They are not false, because I am me.

162
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:42,223
No, you are a person whose false soul was
created by the human named Gendo lkari.

163
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,715
You're nothing but an object living a lie,
pretending to be a person.

164
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,437
See? There's a dark part
of your heart inside you

165
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,688
that you can see nothing of,
that you know nothing of.

166
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,895
That's where the real you is.

167
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,908
I am me.

168
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,449
Because I became who I am
through the time I've spent

169
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,820
and the connections I've made
with other people.

170
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,726
The current me has been molded
through contact with other people.

171
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:16,037
Contact with people and the passage of time
change the shape of my heart.

172
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,716
"Is that what ties are?"

173
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:22,675
Yes, the things that have created the me
called Rei Ayanami so far...

174
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,938
The things that will continue to shape me...

175
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,049
"That is what ties are"

176
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,361
But the real you is somewhere else.

177
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,640
You just don't know it.

178
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,281
Because you don't want to see it.

179
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,217
You're just avoiding it without realizing it.

180
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,117
"Because you're afraid"

181
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,966
Because it may not be human in form.

182
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,986
Because the person that I have been
so far may cease to exist.

183
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:47,883
"You are afraid"

184
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,568
You're afraid of ceasing to exist.

185
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,704
You're afraid of being erased
from everyone's hearts.

186
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,036
Afraid?

187
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,337
I don't understand.

188
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,478
Your own individual world
will also cease to exist.

189
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,807
"It frightens you, doesn't it?"

190
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,598
You will cease to exist.

191
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,810
"It frightens you, doesn't it?"

192
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,313
No, it makes me happy.

193
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,417
Because I want to die.

194
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,252
What I desire is despair.

195
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,887
I want to return to nothingness.

196
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,388
But I can't.

197
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,290
I cannot return to nothingness.

198
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,751
He won't let me return.

199
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,417
He won't let me go back yet.

200
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,286
I existed because he needed me.

201
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,900
But it's over now.

202
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,102
He's not going to need me anymore.

203
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,093
He's going to abandon me.

204
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,513
I thought I had wished for
that day to come, but...

205
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,742
Now, I am afraid.

206
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,439
Come, let us go.

207
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,101
You have existed for this day, today, Rei.

208
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:50,856
Yes!

209
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:51,727
And then...

210
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,627
The instrumentality of mankind begins

211
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,980
Episode Twenty-Five
The World Ending

212
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,281
Once Again, Shiniji lkari

213
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,232
What is this sensation?

214
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,739
I feel like I've experienced it before,

215
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,290
as if the shape of my body is melting away.

216
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,181
It feels so good.

217
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,817
I feel like I'm growing, expanding outward...

218
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,991
On and on...

219
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,023
That was the beginning of the
instrumentality of people

220
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,342
What people are lacking

221
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,546
The loss in their hearts

222
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,867
In order to fill that void in their hearts

223
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,792
The instrumentality of hearts
and souls begins

224
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,144
Returning all things to nothingness

225
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,202
The instrumentality of people had begun

226
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,801
No, it is not that we are returning
to nothingness.

227
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,637
We are only restoring everything
to its original state.

228
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,388
We are only returning to our mother,
who has been lost to this world.

229
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,375
All souls will become one
and find eternal peace.

230
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,814
That is all there is to it.

231
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,449
And that's the Instrumentality Project?

232
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,483
That's right.

233
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,384
There is always a void, a part that
has been lost in our hearts.

234
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,042
That is what gives rise to the
hunger in our hearts

235
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,627
This is what gives rise to fear and insecurity

236
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,261
Every single person fears that
darkness in their heart

237
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,191
and lives life trying to escape from it,
to banish it.

238
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,268
Even though it will never disappear
as long as we remain human.

239
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,004
That's why you're going to bundle
all human souls together,

240
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,273
SO we can compensate for
the void in each other?!

241
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,309
And you're just going to do this to everyone?!
Mind your own business!

242
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,845
That's nothing more than
a conspiracy to deceive us!

243
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,126
But you've been wishing for it to happen too.

244
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,960
Where am I?

245
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,512
In the Case of Misato Katsuragi

246
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:32,291
This is the me that exists
in your mind, Miss Misato.

247
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,892
And at the same time, the me
that exists in your mind, right?

248
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,589
I must connect with all sorts of people
in order for me to find who I am.

249
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,881
I must search deep within myself.

250
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,094
I must search deep within the Miss Misato
that exists in my mind.

251
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,698
What is it that you want, Miss Misato?

252
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:50,999
"You want to be a good girl?"

253
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,261
I have to be a good girl.

254
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,466
"“Why?"

255
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,348
Because my dad's not around.

256
00:11:56,349 --> 00:12:00,018
I have to help my mom and be a good girl.

257
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,654
But I don't want to become like my mom,

258
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,091
because she's always crying
when my dad isn't here.

259
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,262
No crying, no being spoiled.

260
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,964
That's why I have to be a good girl.

261
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,485
And I'm going to do my best
so my dad won't hate me.

262
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,402
But I hate my father.

263
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,538
That's why I hate being good too.

264
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,406
I hate it all now.

265
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,041
And I'm so tired.

266
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,544
Of having to maintain my clean image.

267
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,714
Of myself, for keeping up this pretense
of being so pristine.

268
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,061
I'm just tired of it.

269
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,493
 want to be dirty.

270
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,887
I wanted to see what I looked like
when I was no longer perfect.

271
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,290
Is that why you slept with him? With that man?

272
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,131
No, I slept with him because I loved him.

273
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,630
Did you really love him?

274
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,964
Yes, I did.

275
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,400
He accepted me for who I am.

276
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,070
"Really?"

277
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,136
He was kind to me!

278
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,583
No! Stop it! Don't show this part of me to Shinji!

279
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,156
There's no reason to be embarrassed
after all that has happened.

280
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,991
It IS embarrassing!

281
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,693
Why is it embarrassing?

282
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,230
You have no problem...
no, you actually enjoy

283
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,399
presenting this side of yourself
to the man you love.

284
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,010
No! Please stop!

285
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:27,606
In all honesty, you are actually
happy to show this to Shinji.

286
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,142
That's a lie! You're wrong! Wrong!

287
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,610
I don't know about that.

288
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,379
You actually want to show this
to your father, don't you?

289
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,781
You're wrong!

290
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,351
You sought peace in Kaji's face as he slept.

291
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,419
You're wrong!

292
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,588
You sought peace in Kaji's warmth.

293
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,990
You're wrong!

294
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,527
You sought your father in Kaji's arms.

295
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,668
It's not true!

296
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,398
That's right.

297
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,209
That time, I saw my own father in Kaji.

298
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,494
That's why I ran away from him.

299
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,909
I was scared.

300
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,719
It was as if he were my father and...

301
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,247
But it was actually because I was happy.

302
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,828
I derived pleasure from it.

303
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,453
It was a moment of unbearably
wonderful feeling.

304
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,555
That's why I hated it.

305
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,657
That's why I split up with him.

306
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,427
Well, I guess it just means love
begins for no reason,

307
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,238
but always ends for a reason.

308
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,615
You're so kind, Kaji.

309
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,268
Please take that kindness...

310
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,839
...and tarnish me with it.

311
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,611
Just because you hate yourself now

312
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,646
doesn't mean you should hurt yourself.

313
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:46,007
That's just fooling yourself into feeling better
by punishing yourself for the moment.

314
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,087
You should stop doing that.

315
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,891
And you're going to tell me
to be good to myself, right?

316
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,726
That's what all men are like.

317
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,127
And after that, they go off to work,
into their own worlds.

318
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,647
Leaving me behind...

319
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,915
Just like Father.

320
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,204
All I'm ever doing is running away
from the harsh reality.

321
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,775
Harsh reality?

322
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,543
That's me, isn't it?

323
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,704
Of course, just look at me.
It's only to be expected.

324
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,498
Stop it, Miss Misato!

325
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:23,121
Sometimes, I lose all hope for myself!
I hate it!

326
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,524
Filth, you're so dirty.

327
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,625
You're pathetic.

328
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,827
Disgusting! You're just foul!

329
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,168
That's what you call a mature relationship?!
You make me puke!

330
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,967
Congratulations on your promotion,
Major Katsuragi.

331
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,569
The person being recognized

332
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,238
is the me who's putting on a performance
in order to be recognized.

333
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,879
It's not the real me.

334
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,710
The real you is always crying.

335
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,213
No, I'm happy.

336
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,004
"Am I happy?"

337
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,349
I'm happy.

338
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,170
"Am I happy?"

339
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,186
I am happy!

340
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,007
"Am I happy?"

341
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,923
No! This isn't happiness!

342
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:58,744
"What is happiness?"

343
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,993
This isn't the real me!

344
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,262
I've only made myself believe that it is!

345
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,013
Is that what we have to do to keep on living?

346
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,968
You're afraid when you're not together.

347
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,369
You're insecure.

348
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,538
Unless someone's sleeping by your side.

349
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,774
Are you scared of sleeping by yourself?

350
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,610
Are you lonely sleeping by yourself after all?

351
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,631
You can't bear the loss in your heart.

352
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,615
That's why you'll be with anyone,
it doesn't matter who.

353
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,116
That's not true!

354
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,787
No, you just want to give yourself
over to simple pleasure.

355
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:32,090
You just want to soothe your soul
through temporary escapes

356
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,093
and you're only using men to that end.

357
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:36,824
No! You're wrong! Wrong!

358
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,531
What could it be that she wants?

359
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,088
Where am I?

360
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,306
This is the me that exists in your mind, Asuka.

361
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,817
Which means, it's also the me
that exists in your mind, right?

362
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,172
In the Case of Asuka Langley Sohryu

363
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,514
Asuka, what do you want?

364
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,018
1'm going to live on my own!

365
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,154
I don't need Mom or Dad.
I'm going to live by myself.

366
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,885
I'm not going to cry anymore.

367
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,473
But I'm still crying...

368
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,728
Why am I crying?

369
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,200
I don't know how to deal with that child.

370
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:18,236
What's this? You, a doctor, getting
discouraged? It isn't like you.

371
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,038
Even doctors are human,

372
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,499
as  have mentioned before.

373
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:26,111
But a woman like you having
trouble with a child...

374
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,879
She's oddly mature,

375
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,016
and there's a sense of vigilant
and absolute rejection.

376
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,184
It scares me sometimes.

377
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,854
Haven't you ever felt that way, dear?

378
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,322
No.

379
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:40,625
Anyway, you're Asuka's mother now.

380
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:44,462
But before that, I first became your wife.

381
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,697
You became both at the same time.

382
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,188
Yes, from a social standpoint, that's true.

383
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:52,437
But you can never stop being that child's father,

384
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,428
whereas I can quit being her mother at any time.

385
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,976
True enough.

386
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:01,012
Don't, Mom! Don't quit being my mom!

387
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,782
Il be a good girl, so you'll like me!

388
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,017
So, don't quit being my mom!

389
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,019
So, look at mel

390
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,254
Stop, Mom!

391
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,895
Don't kill me!

392
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:15,671
Your dad doesn't love your mom anymore.
He doesn't need me.

393
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,442
No, he never loved me to begin with.

394
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,706
He probably didn't need me from the start.

395
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,639
So, die with me, because your dad
doesn't need us.

396
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,134
Am l a bother? Am not needed?

397
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,379
Please die with me.

398
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,010
No! I'm not your doll, Mom!

399
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,023
I'll think for myself and live on my own!

400
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,338
That time, my mom was hanging
from the ceiling.

401
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,239
The expression on her face
looked very happy.

402
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,523
But I hated that look on her face.

403
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,990
I don't want to die. I don't want to disappear.

404
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,941
I hate boys. I hate Mom and Dad too!

405
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,576
I hate everybody!

406
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,797
No one will protect me.

407
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,381
No one will stay with me.

408
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,642
What does she want?

409
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,491
That's why I'm going to live by myself.

410
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,270
But I don't want to! It's hard!

411
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,890
I don't want to be alonel

412
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,201
I don't want to be alonel

413
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,699
I don't want to be alonel

414
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,599
Don't forsake me.

415
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,067
Don't abandon me.

416
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,498
Don't kill me.

417
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,222
What is this?

418
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:41,012
The Human Instrumentality Project
that your father was working on.

419
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,013
This is?

420
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,848
It appears to be part of it.

421
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,369
Because the truth eludes even us.

422
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,029
Only what you can feel for yourself
right now is fact.

423
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,551
Within you.

424
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,740
And your memory of those things
will become the truth for you.

425
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,933
There are also some truths
that change with time.

426
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,904
So, this is fact, the result of everything
that was done. This...

427
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,455
There are a lot of realities.
This is one of them.

428
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,138
This is the result you wished for.

429
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,678
The one I wished for?

430
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,949
Yes, annihilation, a world
where no one is saved.

431
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,550
No! It's just that no one saved me! No one...

432
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,422
No one can save you.

433
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,563
This is what you wished for.

434
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,562
Destruction, death, the return to nothingness...

435
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,764
It's what you wished for.

436
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,666
This is reality.

437
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,534
What is reality?

438
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,503
It's your world.

439
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:42,164
It's your own world where you coexist
with time, space, and other people.

440
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:47,946
It's a world where you yourself decide
how to perceive and accept it.

441
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:51,182
Right now, this is your world,
where everything is given to you.

442
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,143
That is reality

443
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,854
This is your world, which cannot be helped.

444
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,723
It's a world where everything's already set!

445
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,274
You're wrong. It's a world where
you make the decisions.

446
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,463
It's a world where your heart
has decided that it is so.

447
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,394
This is reality

448
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,533
Your will to live...

449
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,934
Your thoughts of wanting to die...
They are all what you wished for.

450
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,640
You're saying even this darkness
and this world of half measures

451
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,876
are all things I wished for?

452
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,043
That's right.

453
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,474
You wished for a closed world,
where you alone are comfortable.

454
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,251
In order to protect the weakness of your heart.

455
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,853
In order to protect your pleasures in life.

456
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,122
This is merely the result.

457
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,491
For people cannot live in a world
that is yours alone.

458
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,127
They cannot live in a space
that is closed off.

459
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,799
But you wished for the world, the world
that surrounds you, to be closed off.

460
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,469
Your heart and mind eliminated
everything you didn't like

461
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,337
and wished for a world as solitary as possible.

462
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,908
And that has led to this little haven for your soul.

463
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:55,480
This is one of the many ends that could occur.

464
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,883
This is the end of the world
that you have brought about.

465
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,194
And the journey towards instrumentality...

466
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,852
...will continue

467
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,219
Preview

468
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:12,290
The end, it is something that always
comes after the beginning.

469
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,859
Will our wishes lead to destruction?

470
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,462
Is our hope death itself?
