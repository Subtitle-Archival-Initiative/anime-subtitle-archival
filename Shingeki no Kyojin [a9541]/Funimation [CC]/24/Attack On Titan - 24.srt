1
00:00:02,365 --> 00:00:03,722
You know, Armin.

2
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:07,351
It's nice that I could be a "good person" for you.

3
00:00:07,787 --> 00:00:11,336
For now, at least, it looks like you won your bet.

4
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:12,789
But...

5
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,931
I'm going to gamble, too. And here's my wager!

6
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:24,293
Uh!

7
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:37,380
We believe we've uncovered the
Female Titan's true identity.

8
00:00:38,126 --> 00:00:39,637
She's one of us.

9
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:41,710
Annie...

10
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,341
What's the hold up?

11
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,176
Erwin's never late.

12
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,914
They should be here.

13
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:39,094
At this rate the damn MPs'll show up first.

14
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:40,541
That'd be our luck.

15
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:43,633
Yeah, who can say?

16
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:46,889
Maybe they're all takin' a shit. Duty calls, right?

17
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,411
You're, uh, sure in a talkative mood today.

18
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:54,825
So what if I am?

19
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,780
Doesn't mean I was talkin' to you.

20
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:09,483
It's my fault, sir. I made the choice.

21
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:11,932
If I'd have thought this through none of this...

22
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:13,146
We wouldn't...

23
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:16,532
You made a judgment call.

24
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:19,208
Look, no one expects you to be clairvoyant.

25
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:23,825
Sorry to keep you waiting.

26
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:24,587
Sir.

27
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:27,171
What the...?

28
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,929
Why... Why are you all here?

29
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:34,265
We believe we've uncovered the
Female Titan's true identity.

30
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,492
She won't slip away this time.

31
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:47,239
The day after tomorrow, we'll be passing
through Stohess District en route to the capital.

32
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:48,933
That's when we'll strike.

33
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,897
It'll be our first and only chance to do so.

34
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:56,705
Once we've set foot in the interior,
the government will assume custody of Eren,

35
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,852
and the Scouts' authority to
continue operations will be limited.

36
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:04,920
Thus, unless we wish to concede defeat...

37
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,121
we must flush out the enemy now.

38
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,829
So here's what we do.

39
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:15,335
While in Stohess, we use Eren as bait,

40
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:18,321
luring the target into this underground passage.

41
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:22,443
The deeper, the better. Get her well beneath street level.

42
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:26,243
That done, she should be easily
immobilized, even in Titan form.

43
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:29,181
If she transforms before reaching the tunnel,

44
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,358
well, at that point she'll be your responsibility, Eren.

45
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:36,666
Right. So we know she'll be in Stohess?

46
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:39,177
There's no chance she'll bolt before we get there?

47
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:42,142
No. She won't risk going AWOL.

48
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,174
Wait, you mean she's...

49
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,936
Armin, here, identified her.

50
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:52,053
She's an MP. Likely responsible for
the deaths of Hange's test subjects.

51
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:56,230
And a fellow trainee in the 104th Cadet Corps.

52
00:04:57,935 --> 00:05:00,421
Wha...? You can't be serious.

53
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,073
I trained with her?

54
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,354
I'm sorry, but yes. She's one of us.

55
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,428
No. It can't be.

56
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:17,208
Her name is Annie Leonhart.

57
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:29,701
God...

58
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,269
No.

59
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:38,079
Damn it! That ring!

60
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:41,527
She must've known I was lying
to her from the very beginning!

61
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,252
She knew we were leading her into a trap!

62
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:47,741
I could've... I should've taken a different approach.

63
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:50,290
Save the "should've's" for after we're out of this.

64
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,744
The question now is what do we do next.

65
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:57,534
Okay. First we rendezvous with Squad Three.

66
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,580
Then get the hell above ground.

67
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:02,527
We... We fight her out in the open!

68
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,111
That means we're switching to Plan B.

69
00:06:05,221 --> 00:06:06,674
She's all yours, Eren!

70
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:08,349
Got it?

71
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:09,755
Yeah!

72
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:11,581
Over here!

73
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:13,673
Squad Three!

74
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:16,105
Hey, what happened? Is Plan A a no-go?

75
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:17,742
Afraid so, yes!

76
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:20,212
As of now we're going with the backup option!

77
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:33,131
She caved in the ceiling!

78
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:36,235
We've got to pull them out of there!

79
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,802
Eren! Get back!

80
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:40,399
What? No! Wait!

81
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:42,782
What was that?

82
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,032
Does she not care if she kills you, too?

83
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,146
She took a chance.

84
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:51,642
It was risky, but she gambled
on Eren's being able to survive.

85
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:54,295
We're dealing with someone
who's been backed into a corner.

86
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:00,008
She's desperate. That makes her all the more dangerous!

87
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:11,717
Damn it. We're cut off. If we try to get airborne
with our ODM gear, she'll swat us like flies.

88
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,138
And if we...

89
00:07:18,024 --> 00:07:21,474
If we stay here, it's only a
matter of time before we're crushed.

90
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,367
I know what I have to do! I'll change!

91
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:28,703
I'll shield you guys just like
that time with the cannon fire!

92
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:30,930
Get in close!

93
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,668
But...

94
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:33,947
Alright. Brace yourselves!

95
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,644
Oh no! Not again!

96
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,271
Why now?

97
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:55,765
We don't have time for this. Just work, dammit!

98
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:01,866
Don't try to force it. You have to
have a clear goal in mind like Hange said!

99
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:04,910
C'mon, you can do this. We know you can!

100
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:07,188
Believe me! I'm trying!

101
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:15,667
Really?

102
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:19,546
Are you sure you're not having second thoughts?

103
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,141
Doubts about Annie?

104
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,288
Eren.

105
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,435
It's her. The Female Titan.

106
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:32,691
No matter how much you don't want to
believe it, that won't stop it from being true.

107
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,477
What did we see? Back there just now.

108
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:40,304
She's a murderer. Period.

109
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:42,440
This isn't complicated.

110
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:48,718
Get off my back dammit! I'm not stalling for time!

111
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,103
You think it's Annie?

112
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:55,627
Where's...

113
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,504
Where's your evidence? Tell me!

114
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:03,192
Obviously the Female Titan knew what
you looked like before she attacked.

115
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:08,222
Plus, she reacted to my use of
your "Suicidal Maniac" nickname,

116
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:10,684
something only our classmates would know.

117
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,196
But the biggest reason I suspect her

118
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:17,445
is that I have strong reason to believe
she's the one who killed Sawney and Beane.

119
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,378
You're kinda goin' out on a limb there.

120
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:24,137
Killing two Titans at once
required a precision ODM strike.

121
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:28,093
It only makes sense that the killer would've
used the gear they were most familiar with.

122
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:31,501
But, there was that whole equipment inspection.

123
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:33,360
Annie's totally checked out.

124
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,816
Except, the gear she presented. Well, it...

125
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:40,812
It wasn't hers. It was Marco's.

126
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,555
I don't understand.

127
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:47,249
What's Marco got to do with all this?

128
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:49,385
It's unclear.

129
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:54,708
Maybe you need to get your eyes checked...
Eren. I know what I saw, and the fact is...

130
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,490
Okay, we get it. Do you have anything else on her?

131
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,580
Any sort of concrete evidence?

132
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:00,660
Nothing, sir.

133
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,306
There's the fact that she looks like the Female Titan.

134
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,657
That's something, isn't it?

135
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,993
Really? What the hell's wrong with you?

136
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,875
What kind of evidence is that?

137
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:11,345
So basically, we're going after her without proof.

138
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:13,317
You're kidding me, right?

139
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,917
This is insane! What if it's not her?

140
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:18,617
What if she's not the monster you all say she is?

141
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,778
If it's not her, she'll be cleared. End of story.

142
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,378
No one wants to condemn her
prematurely, least of all me. But...

143
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:31,740
Either we make a move on circumstantial evidence, or
we sit back and let the central government condemn you.

144
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:35,404
Do you even hear yourselves? You're talking about Annie.

145
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:40,051
Eren. Don't stand there and tell me
this conversation isn't ringing any bells.

146
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:51,656
You fought hand-to-hand against the Female Titan.

147
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:55,280
Was there anything about her
techniques that seemed familiar?

148
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:14,739
Dig deep.

149
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:19,028
It's Annie.

150
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,617
You know it is.

151
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:28,283
And you know you have to fight.

152
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:34,257
Unless... Unless there's
something deeper keeping you from it.

153
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:35,625
What?

154
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:42,337
I know what we have to do!

155
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:47,614
Mikasa will head for that opening. At
the same time, I'll make a run for the exit.

156
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,838
I'm sure Annie will go for one of us.

157
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:53,484
When she does, run in the opposite
direction for all you're worth!

158
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,438
Are you out of your mind?

159
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,337
What the hell good's it gonna
do if one of you gets killed?

160
00:11:58,395 --> 00:12:00,707
If we stay here, all three of us will!

161
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:02,914
Mikasa! You ready?

162
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,822
Yeah. Good luck.

163
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,257
Mikasa! Armin!

164
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:11,737
Don't do this!

165
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:14,611
I'm not worth it! You hear me?

166
00:12:14,976 --> 00:12:17,159
You don't have to go!

167
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,459
What choice do we have?

168
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:25,819
The world is a cruel place.

169
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,633
Oh, no! Eren!

170
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:20,067
I won't let you take him! Not this time!

171
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:22,591
Eren!

172
00:13:24,158 --> 00:13:26,708
Eren! Hold on! I'm coming!

173
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:32,186
Come on, stay with me!

174
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,828
Don't let her get away!

175
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:02,238
We have to contain her, whatever it takes!

176
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:09,254
What the hell's going on?

177
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:12,869
Escort Squad! Have a look! I'll hold this position!

178
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,015
Sir, yes sir!

179
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:20,196
This is bad. What in the hell
could be going on this far in?

180
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:21,109
Nile.

181
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,376
Deploy all troops immediately. We should
assume that a Titan has already appeared.

182
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:30,062
Are you out of your mind? This is Wall Sina!

183
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:32,851
There's no way a Titan would just suddenly show up here!

184
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,726
Who told you to move, Jaeger?

185
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,912
How 'bout this damn wig said I could, moron?

186
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:42,733
Call me Jaeger again and it's your ass, you got that?

187
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,704
Commander! What's the plan?

188
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:47,801
Ask Squad Four for equipment.

189
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:48,668
Sir!

190
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:52,832
Like the brass balls, but try not to
swing 'em so hard they get you killed.

191
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,625
Sir.

192
00:14:57,018 --> 00:14:59,203
Hold on. What the hell?

193
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:00,570
Commander! Here!

194
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:03,691
Well done.

195
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,614
Thank you, sir.

196
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,339
Wait just a damn minute!

197
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,986
Alright! All of you with me!

198
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:13,408
We're rendezvousing with the Capture Squad!

199
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:17,197
No! The hell you will!

200
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:24,014
This is outright treason! I am well
within my rights to shoot you where you stand!

201
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,864
Think, Nile. I find it hard to believe
you're actually as thick-headed as you look.

202
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:32,440
You're a hair-trigger away from
making the biggest mistake of your life.

203
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,363
Take off the gear before I shoot you!

204
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:39,751
It's a Titan! It's a Titan!

205
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:42,164
How is it even this far in?
Something's happened to the wall!

206
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:45,271
Whoa. So that's what they look like.

207
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:46,837
Evidently , yeah.

208
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,972
Watch it!

209
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:53,144
Useless MP bastards.

210
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,784
Can't believe there was a time I'd
have given my left arm to be one of 'em.

211
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:59,732
I don't know what the hell I was ever thinkin'.

212
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,348
Right! Don't kill 'er!

213
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,366
Our orders say we only have to stop her!

214
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:21,572
Damn it! It's like she knows every
move we're gonna make in advance!

215
00:16:25,477 --> 00:16:28,468
Try that with me! I dare you!

216
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:37,628
Eren! Talk to me!

217
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:38,979
Wake up!

218
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,933
What the hell's going on?

219
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,071
Help me! He's stuck in here!

220
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,987
Why didn't he just change into a Titan?

221
00:16:46,518 --> 00:16:51,928
He couldn't transform! I... I think there's something
holding him back from being able to take on Annie!

222
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:52,889
What?

223
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,432
We'll worry about that when he's safe.

224
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,466
Help me get him out!

225
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,301
He really couldn't do it.

226
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:04,896
That's it! Enough of your bullshit, Eren!

227
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:07,890
Did I or did I not tell you
this day would eventually come?

228
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,489
Look at yourself! Our fate's in your hands.

229
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:15,986
We're out there puttin' our lives on the line, and
this is all we can expect from our last best hope?

230
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:17,383
Is this what Marco...

231
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:20,212
What he... Damn it!

232
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:31,125
Eren!

233
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,178
Leave him! We can't do anything until we take care of her!

234
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:43,130
Listen. I said something to Jean recently.

235
00:17:44,283 --> 00:17:46,509
To rise above monsters,

236
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,505
we have to abandon our humanity.

237
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:52,917
What we fight, we become.

238
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:54,749
Fire with fire.

239
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:58,293
Look at her. Annie can do it.

240
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:02,679
I don't know why, but there it is. Simple.

241
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,484
You have to match her heartlessness to win!

242
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:20,089
Annie!

243
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,097
Are you gonna kill me or not?

244
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:27,346
I seem to remember you making a wager!
Well here's your chance to make good on it!

245
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:34,295
Armin, follow my lead!

246
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,560
You got it!

247
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:46,708
Yes.

248
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:47,369
Yes.

249
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,465
Commander, you uh...

250
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:51,412
You've got that look in your eye again.

251
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:27,489
Nice! And here I was convinced having
a Plan C was nothing short of paranoid.

252
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:31,120
Oh, Commander Erwin, you genius.

253
00:19:33,782 --> 00:19:35,607
Right. So.

254
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:40,638
Do us a favor.

255
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:42,846
Behave yourself.

256
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:49,854
Oh, and calling your co-horts to dinner isn't an option.

257
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:53,707
So let's not waste that lovely singing voice.

258
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:56,217
In fact, let's not waste anything.

259
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:59,960
No, no, I'm going to read you like bull entrails.

260
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:03,615
Every part of you has its own precious story to tell.

261
00:20:09,303 --> 00:20:10,701
She broke free?

262
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:14,086
Ugh. Dammit, we didn't have time to set enough traps!

263
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:16,143
Don't let her get away!

264
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:25,091
To rise above monsters...

265
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:29,214
...we have to abandon our humanity.

266
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,424
Yeah. I know.

267
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:39,281
That's why... That's why my comrades died.

268
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:42,920
Because I couldn't let go.

269
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:59,214
I swore... to kill them all!

270
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,771
Every last one!

271
00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:09,495
Right or wrong, it doesn't matter anymore.

272
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:14,017
Just kill. Consequences be damned! Damned!

273
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:17,892
Mikasa!

274
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:21,555
Because it is a cruel world.

275
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:31,508
What now?

276
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:08,970
Eren!

277
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:11,885
Eren.

278
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:58,007
"I'm going to kill them all. Every last one."

279
00:23:58,189 --> 00:24:03,206
A vow made in the throes of fury and
despair takes on a new, terrible meaning.

280
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:06,579
For death recognizes no boundary.
