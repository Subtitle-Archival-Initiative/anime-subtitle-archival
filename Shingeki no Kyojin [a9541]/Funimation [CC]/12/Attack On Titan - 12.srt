1
00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:03,881
In the year 845,

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:06,700
two terrifying new breeds of Titan appeared:

3
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:08,630
the Colossal and the Armored,

4
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:13,000
barreling through the outer walls as if
wholesale destruction was child's play.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,223
The territory couched within the
circle of Wall Maria was abandoned.

6
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,083
Twenty percent of the human race perished.

7
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,335
As the Titan onslaught advanced,

8
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:29,715
our only choice was to withdrawal behind Wall Rose.

9
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,390
In the year 850, the Colossal Titan again appeared

10
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:38,224
and decimated yet another barrier between us and them.

11
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:43,389
Once more, mankind retreated in panic
before the advance of its greatest foe.

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,391
Brave soul after brave soul perished.

13
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:47,859
Eaten alive.

14
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,482
Eren! No!

15
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:58,492
Cadet Eren Jaeger, tragically
consumed early on in the battle...

16
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:05,999
later emerged miraculously from
the fallen body of an Abnormal.

17
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,883
Attention!

18
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:16,123
Dot Pyxis, unconventional commander
of the entire Southern Territory,

19
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:19,008
witnessed firsthand Eren's Titan form in action.

20
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,368
Taking note of the boy's incredible strength,

21
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:24,982
a plan worthy of the commander's
fabled eccentricity was hatched.

22
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:27,914
Recall the massive boulder roughly a league from the gate.

23
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:32,362
Having assumed Titan form, Cadet Jaeger
will hoist said boulder on his back,

24
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:34,721
schlep it to the hole, and voila!

25
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:37,661
Should we succeed, history will be made!

26
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,099
Today is the day!

27
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:43,851
Trost regain shall stand as a reclamation
of pride and hope beyond measure!

28
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:46,059
A leap greater than we have ever taken!

29
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:52,652
And yet, despite Eren's ironclad resolve,

30
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:56,345
the plan teetered on the brink
of collapse even as it began.

31
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:40,738
We've managed to corral most of the
Titans in the corner furthest from the breach.

32
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,590
Combat has been avoided as much as possible.

33
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,409
But still, 20% of our forces are lost.

34
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:50,579
Not lost.

35
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:53,979
They did not die of losing their way.

36
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:59,445
They were sent to their deaths. By me.

37
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:03,569
This is the threshold of our extinction, soldiers.

38
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,017
If my actions ensure mankind's survival,

39
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,916
history may call me "butcher" all it wants.

40
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:29,110
Ackerman, look out!

41
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:43,009
Hey! Ackerman! Stand down! Now!

42
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,789
Get away from him. That's an order!

43
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:47,243
Eren! I know you're in there somewhere.

44
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:48,952
I know you recognize me!

45
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:51,378
That's right! Come on!

46
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:54,958
Snap the hell out of it! We've got a breach to seal up!

47
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:56,856
We've failed.

48
00:04:57,134 --> 00:05:00,886
It was foolish to pin our hopes on
something we didn't fully understand.

49
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:10,990
Eren! Listen to me! You're human!

50
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:12,173
Get out of there!

51
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,364
What the hell?

52
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:31,123
You tellin' me the kid was a regular Titan all along?

53
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:31,925
Eren!

54
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:33,101
Captain!

55
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:38,216
We've got two Titans bearing down on us
from the front; a 10-meter and a 6-meter!

56
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:41,497
Heads up! There's a 12-meter
closing in on us from the rear!

57
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:47,133
Ian, that's it. Please. Just look at him.

58
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,540
We need to get out of here; the plan's a bust.

59
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:51,638
Agreed. Full withdrawal.

60
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:53,441
We have to leave him as he is.

61
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,451
Red smoke. That's not good.

62
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:07,878
Sir, at best I'm afraid it means
the elite squad hit quite a snag.

63
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,742
This was pointless.

64
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,487
My friends died like animals.

65
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:17,800
No! Look! Over there!

66
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,794
What? What's happening?

67
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,246
It's over.

68
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:22,783
They failed.

69
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:24,346
But, how?

70
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,820
Whoa! Armin! Where are you going?

71
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:33,203
Commander.

72
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,620
I recommend we revert back to defending the gate.

73
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:38,257
Just give the word, sir.

74
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:39,195
Denied.

75
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:41,849
Sir, shall I order a retreat?

76
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,420
Absolutely not.

77
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,471
Continue luring the enemy to the edge of town.

78
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:49,389
The Elite Squad is well-helmed;

79
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,543
they have leave to make their own decisions.

80
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,314
We proceed as planned.

81
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,563
This was an all-or-nothing proposition.

82
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:59,544
I will allow those at the vanguard
to determine if and when we deviate.

83
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,864
We are not in a position to deliver a verdict of defeat.

84
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:06,026
But, we are in a position to fight to the last breath.

85
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:10,467
It's humanity's debt. It's what we owe the fallen.

86
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,702
Ian! Snap out of it! What are you waiting for?

87
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:14,742
Give the order!

88
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,546
Hey, it's not like this is your fault!

89
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:19,397
Come on! Look, this plan was doomed from the start!

90
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:23,075
We all get that. Was it worth a shot? Sure, whatever!

91
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,769
We did the best with what we had!

92
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:27,628
But all we've got left now is going back over the wall.

93
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:31,362
Stop!

94
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,732
Easy. Now's not the time.

95
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:38,220
Team Rico, take out the 12-meter approaching from behind.

96
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,841
Team Mitabi and I will handle the two front-runners.

97
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:42,207
Are you nuts?

98
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:44,591
In case you've forgotten, I'm the one in charge!

99
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:46,329
Now do as you're ordered, soldier!

100
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,936
We are not leaving Jaeger defenseless, period.

101
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:55,991
Change of plans. Our job now is to keep
the others off him until he can be recovered.

102
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:59,377
Whether we like it or not,
he's still our last best chance.

103
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:01,324
We're not about to abandon him.

104
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:03,715
We're expendable; he isn't.

105
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:05,425
He can't just be replaced.

106
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,965
Please! Don't talk to me about our last best chance!

107
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,689
He's a failure countless soldiers have died because of!

108
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:15,646
Just look at him, Ian! Are you saying
you want more of us to die saving that?

109
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:18,357
That's right. Down to the last man!

110
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:20,089
If that's what it takes, so be it!

111
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:28,239
What the hell's up with the red smoke.

112
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:29,263
What happened to him?

113
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:31,044
I don't know, but Armin's gone to see.

114
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,992
But I... I think it'll be alright.

115
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:34,873
Yeah?

116
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:37,543
Of course! I mean...

117
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:39,291
this is Eren we're talkin' about.

118
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:39,992
Right.

119
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:44,939
I don't wanna be that guy, but this
whole thing feels kind of pointless.

120
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:48,601
Hell, when's the last time a fight
against the Titans didn't feel like that, huh?

121
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:49,762
The best thing now?

122
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,897
Do what we can from losing any more.

123
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:57,301
I don't like the idea of so
many of us being dead for nothing.

124
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:59,127
We have to pick our battles.

125
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:03,530
If we want to wage all-out war someday,
we have to conserve all the manpower we can.

126
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,024
This was the right call.

127
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,462
Just be patient.

128
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,081
Was it the right call, though?

129
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,590
Yes! Of course it was!

130
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:12,442
Live to fight another day, is that it?

131
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,064
Right. I'm in.

132
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:18,442
Ian, you can't be serious!

133
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,492
What other hope against the Titans do we have?

134
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:22,097
You know something I don't?

135
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:25,467
This is it. This is all we've
got, and you damn-well know it!

136
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:27,482
I am making a judgment call here.

137
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:29,320
If you have a better plan, speak up!

138
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:33,085
How else are we ever going to get out
from under their feet? I'm all ears here!

139
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:37,463
If you're asking me how else we'll
defeat the Titans, obviously I have no idea.

140
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:41,872
See? That's why we can't afford to beat a retreat.

141
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:43,374
Not just yet.

142
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:46,853
We may not know what else is in there, but there's hope.

143
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:51,421
And as long as that's the case.
We're gonna fight to the bitter end.

144
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:55,991
Look at us. Always scraping by.

145
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:57,873
Always on the run.

146
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,361
Don't you... Don't you want it to be over?

147
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:03,617
Don't you want to make a stand?

148
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,190
Well, this is how it's done!

149
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,421
This is just... This is madness.

150
00:10:20,342 --> 00:10:20,945
Hey!

151
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,177
I think you're right.

152
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:26,737
If we're to stand, this is the only way.

153
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:28,969
Just this once.

154
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:31,941
Let's fight a fight that's not just a battle of attrition.

155
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:35,144
Let the bastards taste humanity's wrath.

156
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:38,861
Right. My team will address the
12-meter Titan coming from the rear.

157
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:45,234
Well? We got the two in front or don't we?

158
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:46,297
Right.

159
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,682
Thank you, Captain.

160
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:51,890
That was brave.

161
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,694
No, it wasn't. There's no thanks needed.

162
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:58,913
Fact of the matter is I was petrified
of the mess you were about to get into.

163
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:02,076
But you're free now. So do your thing.

164
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,163
Make good use of that inborn skill.

165
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,609
Sir.

166
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:08,700
Go save the man you love.

167
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:10,688
It's not like that.

168
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:20,825
What? Why haven't his injuries repaired themselves?

169
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:23,398
Did the earlier damage compromise him?

170
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:29,117
Oh, Eren. What is this doing to you?

171
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:32,378
Oh god, what if you won't be able to change back?

172
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:35,055
No, I've got to stop.

173
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,870
I'm thinking about it too much, that's all.

174
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:40,181
I need to focus on doing.

175
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:52,607
Eren. Misaka. What's going on?

176
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:24,209
What's... Where am I?

177
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:28,134
What am... What am I doing?

178
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:30,390
Am I sitting?

179
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:33,020
I can't see.

180
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:35,778
What day is it?

181
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:37,491
Wait.

182
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:48,012
Oh. That's right, of course.

183
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:55,822
Weird.

184
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:04,783
Eren.

185
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:08,947
Come on, what are you doing? Wake up!

186
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:11,142
Here's the plan:

187
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:14,987
we don't let a single one of these
ugly S.O.B.'s wander outta this corner.

188
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:18,267
Focus on luring them here and
keeping them here, understood?

189
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:22,795
Do not, I repeat, do not engage them
in combat unless you absolutely have to.

190
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,714
I want you on the ground, three cadets per team.

191
00:13:25,975 --> 00:13:28,097
When you reach the wall, jump. That clear?

192
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:29,893
Die, and you'll piss me off.

193
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:32,538
If a Titan goes astray, we'll put him down.

194
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:37,670
Whaddya mean "if"? It's not like we
can count on them to follow protocol.

195
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,793
What if our situation gets risky?

196
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,461
Are we free to act at our own discretion or what?

197
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,789
Whatever'll make it easier on you.

198
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:48,881
Team Kirschtein, move out!

199
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:49,682
Yes, sir!

200
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:10,499
Son of a bitch... Behind us!

201
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:15,414
It's a 13-meter! And from the looks
of it, he's about to pounce on Jaeger!

202
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,069
Heads up! We've got four more coming through the gate!

203
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,071
All of them 10-meters at least!

204
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:23,412
Right. Rear! Ackerman! Yours!

205
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:24,007
Sir!

206
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,431
Keep it away from him at all costs!

207
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,242
Hold the rest off here!

208
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:28,861
Will do!

209
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:32,888
Elite or not, two teams can't take on four Titans at once.

210
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:49,606
What's going on?

211
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:52,036
Where are they coming from all of a sudden?

212
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,448
There aren't enough of us to attract this many.

213
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:58,513
Unless... Unless they're coming for Eren!

214
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,656
Mikasa!

215
00:15:00,037 --> 00:15:01,680
Why'd the plan go belly-up?

216
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,435
Armin?

217
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,802
Why on earth is he just slumped here like this?

218
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:06,518
Get away. It's dangerous!

219
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:09,642
Something went wrong. He lost
control and wound up like that!

220
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,422
I tried to snap him out of it,
but I couldn't get him to respond.

221
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:14,841
He's been out like this for the past few minutes.

222
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:15,663
But the plan?

223
00:15:15,688 --> 00:15:20,209
We've had to shift tac. Right now all we
can do is protect him. He's defenseless.

224
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:22,158
And there's... There's just so many.

225
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:24,346
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up!

226
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,735
From the back of the head to the nape of the neck,

227
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:42,159
one meter high and ten centimeters across!

228
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:43,667
Armin!

229
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,549
I'm pulling him out of here!

230
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,751
You just hold off the other Titans as long as you can!

231
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:50,642
But...

232
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:55,259
When Eren first emerged from this
form, it was from the weak spot.

233
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:59,652
I dunno. But something tells me
that's a big part of the picture.

234
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,327
How these damn things work.

235
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:04,920
It'll be alright. As long as I don't hit the center.

236
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:07,939
This won't kill him.

237
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,752
But, well, it is going to hurt.

238
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:12,689
A lot.

239
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:13,856
No!

240
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:25,950
Stop it! You'll get yourself killed!

241
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:28,944
I'm fine! Just do what you can to keep the rest at bay!

242
00:16:28,991 --> 00:16:31,765
Trust me, there's tons of other
people you should be worried about!

243
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:34,865
Now leave Eren to me and go do what you do best!

244
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,483
Eren! Can you hear me?

245
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,376
You've got to pull it together!

246
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:48,288
If you stay like this, we're all going to die!

247
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,164
Whatever this body's doing to you, fight it!

248
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,799
You're Eren Jaeger, damn it!

249
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:55,518
What's this steaming lump of flesh have on you, huh?

250
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,726
What is he talking about?

251
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,952
Fight it? What?

252
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:03,247
I'm tired.

253
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:04,709
Come on. Damn it!

254
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,594
Wake up! Get out of there!

255
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:09,032
We need you! Eren!

256
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,799
Your mom, remember?

257
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:16,779
Remember what they did to her?

258
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,210
You were bent on avenging her death!

259
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,030
You swore to massacre the Titans!

260
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:25,884
You're not making any sense, Armin.

261
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:30,476
Open your eyes. Mom's not dead.

262
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,791
Eren! Eren, please! You have to push through it!

263
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:37,372
I know you're in there! Listen to me!

264
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:43,386
If you don't get a move on, the Titans are
going to kill us! It'll all end right here!

265
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:49,132
Armin. Seriously, what the hell's gotten into you?

266
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,799
What's this "get a move on" crap?

267
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,953
I don't wanna "move" anything.

268
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,722
This right here's good enough for me.

269
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:04,949
It's not like I want to be a Scout.

270
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,728
Fantastic. Well, like it or not we're on our own now.

271
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:29,841
Die!

272
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:38,237
Yeah! That's what I thought, you bastard!

273
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,303
Get some distance!

274
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,875
I've got this, Captain!

275
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,914
I'll help Team Mitabi!

276
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,956
What the...?

277
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:06,847
Jean!

278
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:08,238
Get up the wall!

279
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:15,207
I'm sick and tired of people dying because of me!

280
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,574
You malfunction now?

281
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:52,150
Jean!

282
00:19:57,741 --> 00:19:58,840
What's he doing?

283
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:01,929
And why the hell isn't he using his gear?

284
00:20:03,107 --> 00:20:03,931
Hang on!

285
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:06,084
Don't tell me it's not working!

286
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:09,509
I am not going to die today!

287
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,486
Way to go. Draggin' everybody down. Great job.

288
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:41,257
Maybe I won't die today.

289
00:20:44,524 --> 00:20:49,270
Eren. Please. For me.

290
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:52,205
Wake up.

291
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,519
Remember when we were kids?

292
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:58,714
All we could talk about was the world outside.

293
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:04,132
You know, beyond the walls.

294
00:21:04,553 --> 00:21:07,826
Frozen tundra that stretches to the skies.

295
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,629
Sand dunes.

296
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:11,441
Oceans.

297
00:21:12,116 --> 00:21:13,340
Forests.

298
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:16,938
The world my parents wanted to see.

299
00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:22,788
I'd always thought you'd outgrown that dream.

300
00:21:23,272 --> 00:21:25,648
I was kind of sad it didn't come up anymore.

301
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,970
But then I realized you let it go because
you didn't want me to join the Scouts.

302
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,590
No, I... just...

303
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:38,763
Tell me. Honestly.

304
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:44,388
Even though your first step beyond the wall meant
the difference between a warm hearth and hell on earth.

305
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:46,511
Even though it meant risking your life.

306
00:21:46,654 --> 00:21:49,815
Gambling against the possibility of dying like my parents.

307
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:54,548
Why? Why throw caution to the wind and venture outside?

308
00:21:57,456 --> 00:21:59,141
What kind of question is that?

309
00:22:00,308 --> 00:22:03,362
Don't play dumb. You know damn well why.

310
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:10,091
Because the world beyond the wall is my birthright!

311
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,664
Run like hell. Stay alive.

312
00:23:58,268 --> 00:23:59,793
Words run in circles;

313
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:03,258
lives end in blood and ear-piercing screams.

314
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:07,261
But Eren soldiers on, a beacon of hope.
