1
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:06,453
Blades drawn. Now.

2
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:11,313
It'll happen in the blink of an eye. Be ready.

3
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:19,451
Go! Move it!

4
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,466
Holy shit!

5
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:37,398
How the hell are we supposed to
pull evasive maneuvers in here?

6
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:38,438
It's catchin' up!

7
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:41,162
Captain! Engage the ODM gear?

8
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:42,386
Captain!

9
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,796
Where you goin'?

10
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:47,862
Rear Reinforcements!

11
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:05,804
Captain! Your orders!

12
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,246
It's dangerous! Let's take it out!

13
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,597
Tell us to engage, sir!

14
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,298
She's gaining on us! Let's just take her out!

15
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:15,269
That's the whole reason we're here, isn't it?

16
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,271
Right, sir? Captain!

17
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:19,450
Your orders, sir! Please!

18
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:24,542
Everyone cover your ears. Now.

19
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:25,816
Huh?

20
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:27,774
Was that an acoustic round?

21
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,982
Remind me, what is our mission?

22
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,524
Is it to simply act on impulse in the heat of the moment?

23
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:36,822
Let me answer that question for you. It's not.

24
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:40,477
This squad's mission is to keep this brat alive,

25
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:41,797
whatever the cost.

26
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:44,084
Don't forget it.

27
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:49,328
It's not just to police me?

28
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:53,705
We keep pushing forward, on horseback. Is that clear?

29
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:55,069
As a bell, sir!

30
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:59,326
But for how long? We can't keep running forever!

31
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,397
She's right on top of us as it is.

32
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,373
If we don't do something soon...

33
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,385
No!

34
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:09,659
They keep coming! They're all gonna die
unless we turn around and do something!

35
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,743
Eyes front! Stop lookin' behind us!

36
00:04:11,838 --> 00:04:12,711
Seriously?

37
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:14,131
Keep pace with the group!

38
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:16,126
Maintain top speed or we're all dead!

39
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,742
Eld, please! Help them! If the Levi Squad can't
stop this thing, then who can? Those men need us!

40
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:27,527
Another one!

41
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:30,718
Damn it, he didn't have to die!

42
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:36,484
Come on, there's still one left.

43
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:38,381
We can save him before it's too late!

44
00:04:38,406 --> 00:04:40,479
Do as you're told, Eren! Eyes forward!

45
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:43,213
How can all of you just ignore
what's happening back there?

46
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:46,073
Are you tellin' me to abandon my comrades? Is that it?

47
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,360
Damn it, yes!

48
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:49,886
Stop whining and do as your captain tells you!

49
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:51,762
Why are we letting people die?

50
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:53,748
If this is part of some bigger picture,

51
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,733
why can't someone explain it to me?

52
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:58,982
"Ask not the reason why, ask but to do and die!"

53
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:02,407
You'd understand what that meant if
you weren't such a useless greenhorn!

54
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:05,075
Now stifle it. Behave like a soldier!

55
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:10,739
No.

56
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:15,325
I can do this without them.

57
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,976
I don't need to rely on anyone else.

58
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:24,850
I'm a squad all to myself!

59
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:30,794
No, Eren! Stop!

60
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,203
You're only permitted to assume Titan
form when your life's in extreme peril!

61
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,268
That was the agreement! You swore an oath!

62
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:40,988
Eren!

63
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,815
I wouldn't blame you.

64
00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:48,433
Do as your conscience dictates.

65
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:55,091
But Eren, listen. You are not inherently evil.

66
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:58,452
You're ability to change doesn't make you a monster.

67
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,732
That said, it could be the other way around.

68
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:04,234
How're you supposed to know where to draw the line?

69
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,929
Whether you lose control or freely give it up.

70
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,484
Maybe it's the same.

71
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:12,171
And slaughter every Titan that crosses my path!

72
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:19,354
Look, Eren. We don't agree because our
experience brings us to opposing views. That's life.

73
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:23,118
At the end of the day, there's no
reason to go against how you see it.

74
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,941
The choice is yours. You can trust yourself.

75
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:30,921
Or you can trust the people willing
to put their lives on the line for you.

76
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:37,078
I don't know which way is better. I never have.

77
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:42,765
Should I act on my own instincts, or put
myself in the hands of my comrades and trust them.

78
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:45,593
Either way, there's no guarantee.

79
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:49,454
In the end, you choose what you choose.

80
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,604
If afterwards, your regrets
are at a minimum, good for you.

81
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:11,073
Eren!

82
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,649
Trust us.

83
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:25,534
Good news. There may be a way
to stop you without killing you.

84
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:27,106
Sir?

85
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:28,608
In your Titan form.

86
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:31,024
We may have some middle ground after all.

87
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,301
A fail-safe if you will.

88
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,941
The method I've come up with
will only leave you mutilated.

89
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:40,079
Well, at least in theory. Depends on individual skill.

90
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,957
Essentially, we cut the entire
nape from the body, with you inside.

91
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:49,634
Your arms and legs'll be severed halfway
down in the process, but you'll survive.

92
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,757
As a matter of fact, they'll probably just
grow back, lizard-style. Creepy little bastard.

93
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:56,579
Hold on a sec.

94
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,763
I'm not really sure how they do it.

95
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:01,949
I mean, they might but maybe it's
not worth the risk that they won't.

96
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:06,033
Oh, I see. You're only up for this

97
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:08,533
if there's no risk involved whatsoever.

98
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:10,218
No...

99
00:08:10,383 --> 00:08:13,595
Then be prepared. We're in the same boat.

100
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:18,149
If you go on a rampage you could kill us. So we're even.

101
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,510
Yes, sir. Seems perfectly fair to me.

102
00:08:21,764 --> 00:08:24,520
Just to be clear, I have the go-ahead, right?

103
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:28,112
We can't afford not to run tests. So yes, you're good.

104
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:31,085
Just try to keep him from going
rogue right out of the gate.

105
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,706
Oh, not to worry. I have a plan.

106
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:39,507
Eren. I know you're still a mystery
to yourself, but we learn as we go.

107
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:44,435
Knowledge is always worth the risk. I believe that.

108
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:49,392
You ready down there, my dear?

109
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:54,138
When we're good to begin, I'll fire off a smoke signal.

110
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:57,209
What happens after that's entirely up to you.

111
00:08:57,574 --> 00:08:59,354
Ready when you are, Commander!

112
00:09:00,521 --> 00:09:03,986
If the boy loses control, this well
should hold him 'til he wears himself out.

113
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,575
 If not, we'll go with Levi's method. Perfect.

114
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:10,651
Alright.

115
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:15,355
It's been a while. Since Trost, actually.

116
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,484
I've got to keep a hold of myself.

117
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,639
The Levi Squad's well within their
jurisdiction to kill me if I lose control.

118
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:31,553
Hmm.

119
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:34,341
I don't understand it. Perhaps he missed the signal?

120
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:40,190
Perhaps. Or perhaps we're just naive
to expect he can turn it on and off.

121
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:45,648
Eren! Enough! We're done for today.

122
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:49,605
Did something go wrong down there?

123
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,495
I'm sorry. I don't think I can do it now.

124
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:09,331
You're telling me the bite wounds
on your hands show no sign of healing?

125
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:12,192
None, sir.

126
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,528
No offense, but you're not much good to us in this form.

127
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:19,046
If you can't change, our plans
for Wall Maria go up in smoke.

128
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:24,083
Pull it together. And yes, that is an order.

129
00:10:25,454 --> 00:10:26,514
Yes, sir.

130
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:30,805
C'mon, don't lose heart, kid. You'll get it.

131
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:32,720
Maybe, I don't know.

132
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:36,714
Well, that's one hell of a way to
learn you're more human than suspected.

133
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:43,789
Look at it this way, it's a lot better to find out
now than in the field. Back to the drawing board, huh?

134
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:48,062
He's right. No such thing as being too
careful when so much is ridin' on you.

135
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:53,943
How... How can they all be so damn calm?

136
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:58,112
Are they actually relieved I can't turn into a Titan?

137
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,480
Is everything okay?

138
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,306
Yeah.

139
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:23,606
What the...?

140
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:25,108
Titan steam?

141
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,451
What the hell's going on over there?

142
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:40,361
Dammit why now?

143
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:41,380
Calm down.

144
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:45,297
I'm sorry, Captain. I... I don't know how I...!

145
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:50,817
The situation is complicated. Now, calm down.

146
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,005
Please be what I think it was.

147
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,515
Please be what I think it was.

148
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,420
Eren! What the hell do you think you're doing?

149
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,144
Sir, please.

150
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:41,287
No one gave you permission to transform, did they?

151
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:41,985
I said calm down...

152
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,639
Answer the question, Eren! What got into you?

153
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,141
Leave it. Explanations can come later.

154
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,893
First thing's first. You need to persuade us
you're not hostile like your life depends on it!

155
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:53,552
Huh?

156
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:55,371
Prove it or we kill you!

157
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,373
The burden of proof is yours, kid!

158
00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:59,861
So much as twitch an arm and I'll lob your head off!

159
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:02,228
This is the first and only warning you'll receive!

160
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:05,176
I can end you in a heartbeat! Do you understand me, boy?

161
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,502
Oruo! How many times do I have to say it...

162
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:10,624
Captain! I need you to step away. You're too close!

163
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:13,877
Right now, I believe you're the
ones who need to step away. Do it.

164
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:14,758
Why on earth...?

165
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:15,812
A gut feeling!

166
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,355
Eren better say something!

167
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:19,517
I don't... Don't try anything cute!

168
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,088
Prove you're not hostile!

169
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:21,359
Now!

170
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,860
Seriously, I don't...

171
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,456
This is serious! We will kill you!

172
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:25,847
I'll do it! I swear to god!

173
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,223
Are you with us or not?

174
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:28,067
Can you not hear me?

175
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:29,118
That's it! He's dead!

176
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:32,943
Be quiet! All of you just be quiet!

177
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,151
Eren!

178
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:44,417
I wanna touch the arm! I wanna touch the arm!

179
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:48,031
Pretty please with sugar on top!
Let me touch this glorious thing!

180
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:50,708
I don't think that's such a good... Wait, no!

181
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,332
Argh! Son of a bitch!

182
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,304
That mother is hot when there's no skin!

183
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:00,466
This is the best day in the history of science!

184
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:03,994
You're a maniac! You hear me? A maniac!

185
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:06,607
Are you not burning up? What's it like?

186
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:08,379
How is it connected to your hand?

187
00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:11,588
Oh you have to show me! I really, really wanna see!

188
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:15,267
Wait, yeah. I should just be able to pull it out.

189
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:17,777
Come on!

190
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:23,219
Are you ignoring me? Don't try anything stupid!

191
00:14:27,897 --> 00:14:31,228
No! What are you doing? That's too soon!

192
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,738
I wanted to put it under the knife!

193
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:47,299
Sorry, Captain.

194
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:50,174
So you feelin' okay or what?

195
00:14:55,943 --> 00:15:00,423
Not... exactly... No...

196
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:09,696
That was quite a wake-up call, let me tell ya.

197
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:12,069
'Til their blades were drawn,

198
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:15,732
I had no idea how little they trusted me.

199
00:15:15,993 --> 00:15:17,475
And what did you expect?

200
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:20,516
A suspicious nature was the top of my criteria.

201
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,219
Traditionally, you're not considered
a real Scout 'til you come back alive.

202
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:31,145
But out there, there's always so little intel to go on.

203
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:35,747
So many uncertainties and unknowns
it's a miracle any of us come back alive.

204
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:39,353
You have to be reactive, quick.

205
00:15:39,686 --> 00:15:42,117
Hit the ground running while anticipating the worst.

206
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:47,568
That doesn't make them heartless, though.
They're not just a bunch of mindless machines.

207
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:49,545
Whatever that might've looked like out there today,

208
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:52,469
I can promise you that every
single one of them was conflicted.

209
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:54,645
Captain Levi.

210
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:55,296
Hm?

211
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:57,713
Section Commander Hange would like a word, sir.

212
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,061
Man. How long of a shit were you taking, anyway?

213
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:05,284
Oh, long enough to get the job done.

214
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,517
Thank you for asking.

215
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:09,497
Meeting the brass can do a number on your bowels.

216
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:11,506
But enough about that.

217
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:14,825
Feast your eyes on this.

218
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:17,321
That's the spoon, right?

219
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:18,490
The very one.

220
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:23,560
Your spontaneous Titan arm erupted
into being while holding it. Like so.

221
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:26,246
Resting between the thumb and the index finger.

222
00:16:27,706 --> 00:16:31,259
The world operates on chance,
so coincidences are expected.

223
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,991
But this begs something more.

224
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,025
This utensil wasn't warped by the heat or by the pressure.

225
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:37,837
Any thoughts on the matter?

226
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:41,571
Uh... All I know is that I went to pick it up.

227
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:44,160
When I did the arm came out of nowhere.

228
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,728
Interesting.

229
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:50,105
This might explain why you couldn't change in the well.

230
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,588
I'm certain of it.

231
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:54,855
Slaying Titans.

232
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,333
Blocking cannon fire.

233
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,009
Lifting big rocks.

234
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:04,396
In each instance before assuming Titan form
seemingly at will, there was a distinct goal in mind.

235
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:08,884
I believe it's possible that self-harm
isn't the only catalyst of transformation.

236
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:12,689
It appears as though a clear objective
is a crucial ingredient as well.

237
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:15,782
I think you might be on to something.

238
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:19,016
This last time was a lot like
the time with the cannon ball.

239
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,319
But I...

240
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:24,857
I transformed into a Titan just to pick up a damn spoon?

241
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:27,470
That's insane.

242
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:34,199
So, uh. What I'm getting out of this is what
you pulled wasn't something you did on purpose?

243
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:35,192
No, sir.

244
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:55,156
What the...? What the hell you think you're doing?

245
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,309
Ow.

246
00:17:57,436 --> 00:18:00,527
'Kay, that hurts like a son of a bitch. Damn, kid.

247
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,253
I'm impressed you can sink your
teeth in that deep without shrieking.

248
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:05,931
We made a judgment call today and it was wrong.

249
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:08,390
Consider this our way of apologizing.

250
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,134
That is if you can find it in your heart to forgive us.

251
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:12,437
Huh?

252
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:15,286
We have to make spur of the moment decisions, okay?

253
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:17,975
Make the best call we can with what we know.

254
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:20,223
It's our job to keep you in check!

255
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:22,098
The fact is we were scared.

256
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:24,275
That's no excuse, I know.

257
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:26,992
You've every right to be upset.

258
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,337
But... All that aside,

259
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,714
we're doomed if we can't trust one another.

260
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:35,114
Just as you are if you can't trust us.

261
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:41,150
Eren.

262
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:43,430
I'm asking you.

263
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:45,146
Trust us!

264
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:58,709
Eren! C'mon! Make up your damn mind!

265
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,171
I'm with you!

266
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,719
No!

267
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:19,009
Forgive me!

268
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:28,423
Target is accelerating!

269
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:31,139
Just keep moving! We'll outrun the bitch!

270
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:36,724
Outrun it? Are you kidding me?

271
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:39,356
We keep riding with our backs to her like this,

272
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,659
we'll be crushed before we know what hit us!

273
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:47,999
No. We're at death's door.

274
00:19:48,612 --> 00:19:51,281
We've seen our comrades die left and right.

275
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:53,441
And we're still moving forward.

276
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,310
They trust the captain, and he trusts them.

277
00:19:58,015 --> 00:19:59,812
That's what this is about.

278
00:20:00,113 --> 00:20:02,197
That's why they can all keep moving.

279
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:07,948
I... I need to be a part of it.

280
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,787
I need to trust them, like they trust me!

281
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:32,427
Fire!

282
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:54,849
Everyone hitch your horses a bit further on.

283
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:56,411
Switch to ODM gear.

284
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:59,137
I have to break away for a little while.

285
00:20:59,444 --> 00:21:01,315
Eld's in charge 'til I get back.

286
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:05,375
Tuck Eren somewhere out of
sight, away from the Female Titan.

287
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:07,012
And see to my horse.

288
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:13,479
Wait, what?

289
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:17,674
They're going to take her alive? Seriously?

290
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,434
So what do you think of us now, Eren?

291
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:26,611
We managed to outsmart the damn thing!

292
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:29,153
Let this be a lesson to you, greenhorn!

293
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,472
Don't ever underestimate the Scouts!

294
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:33,951
Never again! Agreed?

295
00:21:34,682 --> 00:21:35,612
Agreed!

296
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,151
She's not putting up much of a fight.

297
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:44,414
That's no reason to let our guard down.

298
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,538
Good work leading her here.

299
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:48,579
I'm more than a little impressed.

300
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:54,632
We couldn't have without the rear contingent
whose lives bought us time. This belongs to them.

301
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,476
I don't intend to ever forget that.

302
00:21:58,008 --> 00:21:59,159
That so?

303
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:00,574
Yes.

304
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:04,492
Because of their sacrifices,

305
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:07,329
we can expose whoever this really is.

306
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:12,884
Ten to one they're in there
pissing themselves right about now.

307
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:59,373
Erwin Smith's top-secret plan to
capture the Female Titan has succeeded.

308
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:03,388
But as the Scout Regiment
attempts to reveal her true identity,

309
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:06,825
they find a nasty shock waiting for them.
