1
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:04,997
C'mon. It's an easy
question. So answer it.

2
00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:07,453
What the hell is
it you want to do?

3
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:15,078
I want to become a
member of the Scouts,

4
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:18,028
and slaughter every
Titan that crosses my path.

5
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,816
Huh. Well played.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,593
Alright, then. I'll
take responsibility for him.

7
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,452
Let the higher-ups
know what's going on.

8
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:33,653
Not that I implicitly
trust him, of course.

9
00:00:33,749 --> 00:00:38,478
It's more a matter of me trusting myself
to deal with him. Kill him, if I have to.

10
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:41,123
The big wigs aren't
likely to raise a stink.

11
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:43,855
My record more than speaks
for itself, I'm pretty sure.

12
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,792
Good news, Jaeger.

13
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:48,704
You're now officially
a member of the Scouts.

14
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,812
Hey.
You think it's true?

15
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:44,712
There's a Titan
fighting on our side now?

16
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:47,303
When did you start
believing everything you heard?

17
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:49,638
More likely the
recapture plan failed.

18
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:53,532
And now refugees from Wall Rose
are going to start flooding in here.

19
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:57,813
And once those people swarm us, our
supplies'll run out in a matter of days.

20
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,452
Wait. So if the Wall Rose people
really do have a Titan with them,

21
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:04,614
you don't think they'd be crazy
enough to bring him in here, do you?

22
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,699
Hey. Have you
heard the good news?

23
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:12,900
The military
has a Titan on the team!

24
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:15,330
Can you
believe it? Who knows?

25
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:17,729
We might even be
able to retake Wall Maria!

26
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:20,360
Finally,
humanity has a Savior!

27
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:28,122
Saviour, huh?

28
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,081
Since the dawn of history,
commoners have always been a rash lot.

29
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:38,707
These rumors get any more out of
control, we'll have a revolt on our hands.

30
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,393
Not today. This
so-called "Savior"?

31
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:43,308
We'll make an
example out of him.

32
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:47,263
I'll be damned if he's
allowed to join the Survey Corp.

33
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:52,037
Form ranks!

34
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:02,112
All hail to the Premier!

35
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,418
Damn, hot day.

36
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:10,541
Commander Pyxis.

37
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,853
You're the C.O. of
the Garrison Regiment.

38
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:16,182
And I'm the Commanding Officer
of the Survey Corp and the Scouts.

39
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,041
Some people might disapprove
of our meeting like this.

40
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,402
Ha! You're as straight-
laced as your reputation.

41
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:28,679
Nothing untoward here. We just coincidentally
bumped into one another while out for a morning stroll.

42
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:33,796
Protocol doesn't prevent us from
chatting under the circumstances.

43
00:04:34,304 --> 00:04:39,326
You are aware the Military Police plan
to take custody of Eren Jaeger, I presume.

44
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:42,206
Yes. I received
word yesterday.

45
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:45,206
They plan to hold
a deliberation on the matter.

46
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:48,709
Hm. The decision has
been left to Premier Zachary.

47
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:53,784
Whether Cadet Jaeger's future lies with the
Scouts, or in the hands of the Military Police.

48
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:57,201
Zachary? You mean
Premier Dhalis Zachary?

49
00:04:58,201 --> 00:05:00,888
The Military Police.
The Garrison Regiment.

50
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:01,833
And the Scouts.

51
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:04,426
All three fall
under his jurisdiction.

52
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:08,412
His decision will be
based entirely on one factor:

53
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:12,899
Is Eren Jaeger's existence a
benefit or a handicap to our survival?

54
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,824
If deemed
detrimental, Jaeger will be

55
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:17,521
executed
without a thought.

56
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:19,903
Right then
and there, if need be.

57
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:23,170
I, for one, do
not want to see him die.

58
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:27,931
However, many in the Garrison
Regiment, I'm sad to say,

59
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,634
are fearful of Eren's unique
ability. My hands are tied.

60
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,273
The most I can do is avoid
agreeing with the M.P.'s.

61
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,047
Do the odds favor you?

62
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:42,446
No, they don't.

63
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:45,655
And yet, we do have
a proposal prepared.

64
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:48,270
Whether it
will work or not,

65
00:05:48,318 --> 00:05:50,573
all depends on
how the debate unfolds.

66
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,649
You mean, you're
going to play it by ear?

67
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,710
Our job is reconnaissance
beyond the walls.

68
00:05:57,796 --> 00:05:59,848
Playing things by
ear is all we ever do.

69
00:06:00,553 --> 00:06:01,365
Ha!

70
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:05,789
You're not so uptight
after all, it would seem.

71
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,864
Thank you for the pleasant
conversation. And good luck, Commander!

72
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:16,863
A debate over Eren?

73
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,722
What for?

74
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:22,544
I'm not really sure, but, it might
be about what they plan to do with him.

75
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,387
And what does that mean?

76
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,236
It means...

77
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,182
they may not let him live.

78
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:37,240
Cadet Mikasa Ackerman. And
Cadet Armin Arlelt. Hop to!

79
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:38,464
Sir!

80
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:43,183
You're ordered to attend and act
as witnesses at today's deliberation.

81
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,878
'Scuse me. I gotta pee.

82
00:06:54,903 --> 00:06:56,048
No, you just went.

83
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:59,153
Then can I have some water?

84
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,605
Hey!

85
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,291
You're not getting a
thing, got it? Damn monster.

86
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:12,768
Monster. I guess he's
not too far off the mark there.

87
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,954
Frightened
of me or not, though,

88
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:18,153
I don't deserve this.

89
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:20,946
Except how
can I blame him?

90
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:23,449
I don't even
understand what's going on.

91
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:28,143
On the bright side, at least these
guards haven't tried to kill me yet.

92
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,468
When I think back,
they weren't afraid of me.

93
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,152
Even after
everything they'd seen.

94
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,482
I wonder what
they're doing now.

95
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:47,957
And all the others.
I wonder what happened to them.

96
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:53,765
Just hang on
a little longer, Eren.

97
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:56,228
We'll keep trying
to sort all this out.

98
00:07:58,364 --> 00:08:00,439
I've been
in here so long.

99
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:04,207
What's been happening
outside of these bars?

100
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:08,893
I'm... I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life like this, am I?

101
00:08:19,364 --> 00:08:21,405
So then, you're Eren?

102
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,531
Are you well?
How're things?

103
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:26,089
I'm really sorry
you've been waiting so long.

104
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,422
But here's your
chance to finally get out.

105
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,129
Uh.

106
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:33,695
One thing. You'll have to
put these on for me, okay?

107
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,570
My name is Zoe Hange.

108
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,905
I'm a section
commander for the Scouts.

109
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:43,963
This is a fellow
commander in the Scouts,

110
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:45,509
Miche Zacharius.

111
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:46,599
Uh...

112
00:08:46,782 --> 00:08:52,083
Oh. Don't mind him. He makes a habit
of giving new people a thorough sniff.

113
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:54,791
Tends to laugh
through his nose a bit.

114
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:57,739
But I don't think
he intends it to be derisive.

115
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:01,822
Quirks aside, he is
a skilled section commander.

116
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:10,910
Oh, poo! Sorry. I've just been prattling
on with the small talk, and now we're here!

117
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,103
Well,
I'm sure it's fine.

118
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:16,304
It's probably better
if I don't explain, anyway.

119
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:18,227
Hey! Hold on!

120
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,976
It might seem
callous, but remember...

121
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:23,700
we've all put our
faith in you, Eren.

122
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,531
Best of luck!

123
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:26,173
Wait!

124
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:41,329
A courthouse?

125
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,286
I was in the basement
of a courthouse this whole time?

126
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,955
All right. Move it!

127
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,913
On your knees. Now!

128
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:14,175
Why're all of these
people here, just staring at me?

129
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:17,368
Somebody gonna explain
what the hell's going on?

130
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:20,219
My friends.

131
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,842
All right. Shall we begin?

132
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:36,729
Your name is Eren
Jaeger.

133
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:40,670
And as a soldier, you have sworn to give
up your life when called to,

134
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:43,196
for the good of
the people. Is that correct?

135
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:44,562
Yes.

136
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:51,259
As an enlisted soldier during a time of war, military
doctrine demands your tribunal be held as a court-martial.

137
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:55,136
As Commander of our armed forces,
this matter is left to my discretion.

138
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,228
Thus, I will decide
whether you live or you die.

139
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:01,452
I knew it!

140
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:03,288
Any objections?

141
00:11:04,906 --> 00:11:05,878
No, sir.

142
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:09,882
Your astuteness is
appreciated. Let us proceed.

143
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:15,644
As expected, covering up your
existence has proven quite fruitless.

144
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:19,640
And unless we publicly disclose your
existence one way or another,

145
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:22,896
we risk the outbreak of widespread
civil unrest.

146
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:24,994
A choice must be made.

147
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,426
And the regiment that takes custody
of you will determine your fate.

148
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,873
The Military Police...

149
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,105
or
the Scout Regiment?

150
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:37,760
To begin. The Military Police
will now present their case.

151
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:40,557
Thank you.
My name is Nile Dawk.

152
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,089
I am Commander
of the Military Police.

153
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:47,638
Our recommendation, following a thorough
examination of his physiology,

154
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:51,076
subject Eren Jaeger should be disposed
of immediately.

155
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:57,743
We acknowledge that Jaeger's ability played a
part in turning back the latest Titan incursion.

156
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:03,256
However, as has been stated, his mere existence
is creating a swell of rebellious sentiment.

157
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,943
For the greater good, after we have gathered
all the information that we can from him,

158
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:11,124
we would see him made a
fallen warrior of humanity.

159
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,879
Unacceptable!

160
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,216
This verminous fiend has
defiled the mighty Wall...

161
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,547
Another deranged
Wall Cultist.

162
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:21,173
Five years ago,
everyone ignored them.

163
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:23,437
Now they've
actually got some clout.

164
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:28,235
And now I'd like to hear the
Scout Regiment's proposed plan.

165
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:29,799
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,572
As the commander
of the Survey Corp,

167
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:35,393
I, Erwin Smith,
propose the following:

168
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,128
Let Eren join our
ranks.

169
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:44,363
Reinstate him as a full member of the Scouts, and we
will utilize his Titan ability to retake Wall Maria.

170
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,246
That is all.

171
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:51,087
Hm? Is that it?

172
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:54,216
Yes. With
his assistance, sir,

173
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,599
I'm certain we
can reclaim Wall Maria.

174
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:59,832
Ergo, I believe our top
priority is perfectly clear.

175
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:06,420
Quite bold. Assuming you were given clearance,
where do you plan to launch this operation from?

176
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:08,279
Commander Pyxis.

177
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:12,047
The wall in Trost District has been
completely sealed, is that correct?

178
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,152
Yes. I doubt its
gate will ever open again.

179
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,670
We'll depart from
Calaneth District, to the east.

180
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:21,657
From there, we'll
make for Shiganshina.

181
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:25,361
A new route can be
establish as we proceed.

182
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:30,000
But that's ridiculous! Our time and money
would be better spent sealing up all the gates!

183
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:33,854
They're the only parts of the Wall
that the Colossal Titan can break, right?

184
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,636
Let's reinforce the blasted things
and wash our hands of the entire affair!

185
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:40,050
Shut your mouth,
you spineless merchant dog!

186
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:43,278
With a Titan on our side, we
can finally return to Wall Maria!

187
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:47,751
We can't afford any more of your childish
antics, or your delusions of grandeur!

188
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:50,105
Squealing louder
won't help your case, pig.

189
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,591
While we're
bolstering our defenses,

190
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:55,871
do you think the Titans
are going to stand idly by?

191
00:13:56,181 --> 00:14:01,765
And when you say "we can't afford," do you speak
for anyone other than your fat merchant friends?

192
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:05,190
Do you pigs even
realize that most of our people

193
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:08,589
are struggling just to survive
off what little land we have left?

194
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:13,205
I'm simply saying that sealing the gates
is the only guaranteed protection we've got!

195
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,892
Hold your tongue, you
vile, belligerent heretic!

196
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:21,015
Are you really suggesting that we lowly humans
meddle with Wall Rose, a gift to us from on high?

197
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:22,390
The Wall is a miracle.

198
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:24,893
And its divinity
transcends human comprehension.

199
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:26,308
Don't you understand?

200
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:30,875
It's that cult's fault. They're the ones
who delayed the garrison's arming of the Walls.

201
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,982
That shows you the sick amount of support and
power they've got. I don't trust them at all.

202
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:35,881
...to pieces!

203
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:36,992
Such sacrilege!

204
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:39,104
Oh, you're
insane. Shut yer trap!

205
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,399
How dare you!

206
00:14:43,197 --> 00:14:45,382
Order! I ask
that you save your personal

207
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:48,139
sentiments for
a more appropriate venue.

208
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:51,088
Now then Mr. Jaeger,
I have a question for you.

209
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:55,567
As a soldier, you have made a solemn
pledge to answer humanity's call.

210
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:58,429
Can you still serve
by controlling your ability?

211
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,257
Yes! I will, sir!

212
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:01,870
Oh? Is that so?

213
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:06,160
But this report from the Battle
for Trost contradicts that statement.

214
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:08,645
Just after transforming,

215
00:15:09,018 --> 00:15:12,268
it seems you made an attempt
to crush Mikasa Ackerman.

216
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:16,305
He doesn't
even remember.

217
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:18,689
He completely
lost control.

218
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,547
What'd you expect? You want
me to lie in the report?

219
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:25,316
Glossing over that important fact could
potentially spell disaster for us all.

220
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:27,405
And who is
this Mikasa Ackerman?

221
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:29,383
Me! That would be me, sir.

222
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:34,720
Alright, then. Is it true that Eren Jaeger
assaulted you while he was in Titan form?

223
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:40,727
Answer the Premier honestly.
Eren's future depends on it.

224
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:48,276
Yes. All of that's true.

225
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,971
I knew it! He's
a wolf in sheep's clothing!

226
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:56,054
I... I tried
to kill Mikasa?

227
00:15:56,272 --> 00:15:58,111
What's happening to me?

228
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:01,743
However, he also
saved my life twice before.

229
00:16:01,806 --> 00:16:05,031
And in each circumstance he
was using his Titan ability.

230
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,328
The first:
shortly after Trost fell.

231
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,308
I was nearly
killed by a Titan.

232
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:11,905
But then Eren came.

233
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,008
He stepped
in and protected me.

234
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,860
The second
time: he transformed to

235
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:20,690
shield Armin
and me from cannon fire.

236
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,584
I implore you to take these
facts into consideration.

237
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:25,727
Objection!

238
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:31,632
I have reason to believe that personal
feelings play a large part in her testimony.

239
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:35,634
Let the record show that Mikasa
Ackerman was orphaned at a young age

240
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,582
and was subsequently taken
in by the Jaeger family.

241
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:44,390
What's more, our own internal
investigation into this matter

242
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:47,003
led to a most
shocking discovery.

243
00:16:48,836 --> 00:16:51,193
Eren Jaeger
and Mikasa Ackerman,

244
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:56,664
at the tender age of nine, dealt with three
adult kidnappers by stabbing all of them to death.

245
00:16:57,903 --> 00:17:00,344
Granted, this
was done in self-defense.

246
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:04,214
All the same, one cannot help but
question the violent nature of the act.

247
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:07,773
Knowing all of this,
should we really invest in him?

248
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:11,889
Money, manpower. Perhaps
the very fate of us all?

249
00:17:11,984 --> 00:17:15,655
Maybe he's a Titan that snuck in here after
taking the form of some little child he ate?

250
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:18,925
Maybe she's one! I bet
she's not human either!

251
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,247
Yeah, you're right!

252
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:22,304
Dissect her too,
just to be safe!

253
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,731
Now hold on a second! Maybe I'm a monster
that you want dead, but you leave her out of this!

254
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,026
She's innocent!

255
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:30,163
Like we'd trust you!

256
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:30,988
It's the truth!

257
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:33,116
She must be
one if you protect her!

258
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:34,530
Stop it!

259
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:41,570
You're wrong.
About it all.

260
00:17:42,443 --> 00:17:45,859
But you're so intent
on pushing selfish agendas,

261
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:48,348
you're blind to
what's in front of you.

262
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:50,318
Wait. What do you mean?

263
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,074
What does it even matter?

264
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:53,151
What am I saying?

265
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:55,196
None of you have
even seen a Titan,

266
00:17:55,347 --> 00:17:57,317
so why're you so afraid, huh?

267
00:17:57,803 --> 00:17:59,559
Maybe I should
just keep quiet.

268
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:02,318
No. If
they wanna kill me,

269
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,318
I'll let them
know exactly what I think.

270
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:09,234
There's no sense in having power if
you're not going to use it to fight!

271
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:12,348
If you're too scared
to fight for your lives, fine.

272
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:14,024
Let me do it!

273
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,608
You... You're all cowards!

274
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,330
What?

275
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:23,502
Just shut up. And put
all your faith in me!

276
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:28,993
Take aim, dammit!

277
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:30,541
Right! Yes, sir!

278
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,355
Huh?

279
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:48,892
Mikasa, wait!

280
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,091
You know, personally,

281
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,310
I think nothing
instills discipline like pain.

282
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:02,491
You don't need a
good "talking-to".

283
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:05,585
What you're in need of,
boy, is to be taught a lesson.

284
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,945
And you happen to be
in perfect kicking position.

285
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:21,315
N-Now hold on, Levi!

286
00:19:22,017 --> 00:19:23,103
What is it?

287
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,097
It's dangerous.

288
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,332
What if he gets
angry? Turns into a Titan?

289
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:33,295
Don't be silly.

290
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:38,109
After all, you guys just want
to dissect him, don't you?

291
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:41,773
During the time that
he was transformed,

292
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,026
they say that Jaeger was able to kill twenty
Titans before he finally ran out of strength.

293
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:50,051
As an enemy, his intelligence
makes him all the more dangerous.

294
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:53,175
But I could still take
him down without a problem.

295
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:56,090
How many of
you can say the same?

296
00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:59,401
Before you torment
the beast, you'd better think.

297
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:02,214
Can you
actually kill him?

298
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,536
Sir.
I have a proposition.

299
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,332
Proceed.

300
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:10,232
There's still too
much we don't know.

301
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,651
And no doubt, his danger
will be ever present.

302
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:15,077
As such, I suggest this:

303
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:18,901
Eren Jaeger will be placed
under Captain Levi's supervision.

304
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:22,094
And we'll conduct a recon
mission outside of the wall.

305
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:24,112
Jaeger will join
you in this excursion?

306
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:27,813
Yes, sir. Then you can look upon
the mission's results yourself.

307
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:31,120
And if he successfully
controls his ability...

308
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:34,839
Eren will have proven
his value to mankind.

309
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,619
Eren Jaeger will
be closely supervised?

310
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:40,758
And if he should lose control?

311
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,712
I can definitely
kill him, if it comes to that.

312
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:48,305
The only downside is, there's
absolutely no middle ground.

313
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:55,789
Hm. Then I
have made my choice.

314
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,528
Well that went
better than I expected.

315
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:04,361
Does it hurt?

316
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:05,484
Yeah.

317
00:21:05,918 --> 00:21:07,905
Yeah? Describe it to me!

318
00:21:07,937 --> 00:21:08,501
Huh?

319
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,783
Sorry for all that.

320
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:13,999
But the theatrics did get
you placed in our custody.

321
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:16,184
No, I understand.

322
00:21:16,287 --> 00:21:18,434
I can assure
you the pain was worth it.

323
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:21,562
We played our trump
card at the perfect time.

324
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,400
You have my utmost respect.

325
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:29,064
Eren, I'm glad that
you're on our team.

326
00:21:29,214 --> 00:21:32,050
Uh? Me, too!
Glad to be here, sir!

327
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:35,990
So, Eren.

328
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:36,831
Sir?

329
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:39,828
You don't resent
me now, do you?

330
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:43,523
N... No. I can see that what
you did was necessary, sir.

331
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,278
Good. Then you understand.

332
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,829
Still, don't you
think you went too far?

333
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:49,672
I mean, you
knocked his tooth out!

334
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:50,642
Neat, huh?

335
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:52,827
You picked
it up? How disgusting.

336
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:55,265
This is a precious
sample I'll have you know!

337
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:59,087
Hey, just be glad people
like that aren't dissecting you.

338
00:21:59,238 --> 00:22:01,398
Don't you dare
to compare me with them.

339
