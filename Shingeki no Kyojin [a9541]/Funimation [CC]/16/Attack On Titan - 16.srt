1
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,579
When did you last replace your shaft?

2
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,835
After the mop up, sir. That was six days ago.

3
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:48,917
Right. She's clear.

4
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:51,223
Okay, you're good. Who's next?

5
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:54,827
I'm with squad 42. Christa Lenz, sir!

6
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:56,303
Well, let's take a look.

7
00:01:57,171 --> 00:02:00,395
So now we can actually get in trouble for killing Titans?

8
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:03,743
Yeah, it's crazy, but they were valuable test subjects.

9
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:08,222
I know that. What I don't understand is why
they're trying to find the killer among the cadets.

10
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,473
Right, we're worn out enough as it
is from cleaning up the battlefield.

11
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:12,957
Who'd have the energy?

12
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:17,311
Guess someone hated lookin' at
those Titans even more than I did.

13
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,865
Mm. The sad thing is they may've actually
helped the Titans more than anything.

14
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:25,973
All that knowledge lost, and for
what, someone's personal revenge?

15
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,783
It just doesn't make any sense.

16
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,415
Well, it might sound dumb, but I'm glad they did it.

17
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,592
Before I'd actually seen a Titan, I was convinced

18
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:36,594
I wanted to be a Scout and take 'em all on.

19
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:39,392
Now I never wanna lay eyes on one again.

20
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:43,886
And today, we have'ta pick which Regiment to join.

21
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,906
Jean. Are you really gonna do it?

22
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:10,605
I guess regret's the order of the day.

23
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:16,023
Right about now, we're all wondering
why the hell we ever put on this uniform.

24
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:19,645
Standing here, watching our friends burn.

25
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:22,339
How could we possibly think anything else?

26
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:33,638
Sorry, Marco.

27
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:37,904
I don't even know which of these bones are yours, anymore.

28
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:45,509
If I hadn't become a soldier,

29
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:48,924
I would've never had to worry about who's next.

30
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:54,948
So, you're tellin' me it's better
to just cut our losses, is that it?

31
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,957
Let all the death and destruction be meaningless?

32
00:03:58,282 --> 00:04:01,921
We have to fight. I know that's the right thing to do.

33
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:07,173
But I also know I'm not a suicidal maniac like he is.

34
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:10,318
Huh?

35
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:15,609
Promise me you're not gonna take this the wrong way.

36
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,804
But I don't think you're a
good leader 'cause you're strong.

37
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:21,431
I think it's 'cause you know what it is to be weak.

38
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:23,098
You're one of us.

39
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:26,198
You're scared out of your mind, just like we all are.

40
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:28,472
It makes you alert; sympathetic.

41
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:40,508
So, what am I going to do now?

42
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,789
Hey guys. Question for you.

43
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,559
Huh?

44
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:48,619
So have you decided yet?

45
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:50,817
Which regiment you're gonna join?

46
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:56,819
I've made my choice. It'll be rough, but...

47
00:04:57,549 --> 00:05:02,015
Dammit. I'm gonna join the Scouts!

48
00:05:12,636 --> 00:05:17,140
Ah, hell. Hey, Annie. You think Jean meant it?

49
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:19,787
You think he's serious about signing up with the Scouts?

50
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:21,789
Wait. Jean said that?

51
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:22,955
Who cares?

52
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,176
So you're sticking with the MPs, huh?

53
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:28,106
I'm really startin' to think I might go that way, too.

54
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,640
Tell me something.

55
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:33,216
If someone ordered you to die, would you do it?

56
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:36,027
W-What? Of course not.

57
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:39,658
Well, then my advice is do what's best for you.

58
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,931
And what about you, Armin?

59
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:45,799
Oh, uh, I think I might.

60
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:48,519
If the situation truly called for it.

61
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,521
And I knew that my sacrifice might save others.

62
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:53,356
Not that I'd want to.

63
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,557
So, you've decided then.

64
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,393
Mm. I've planned to join the Scouts from the start.

65
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,652
Come on. Not you too, Armin?

66
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:07,745
I'm impressed. For a mouse,
you've got guts; I'll give you that.

67
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:09,628
Uh. Thanks, I guess.

68
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:13,854
You know, I'm beginning to suspect
you care more than you let on.

69
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,560
Huh?

70
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,480
It's just, the way you're trying to discourage
us from the Scouts, you're looking out for us.

71
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,746
Is that why you're joining the MPs?

72
00:06:21,857 --> 00:06:24,153
I bet you think you can do some good there too, huh?

73
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:25,891
No, not really.

74
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:28,511
I just want to live.

75
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,189
The only person I'm looking out for is myself.

76
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:44,489
After that whole inspection, they didn't turn up
one person who used their ODM gear without permission.

77
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,398
So who could'a done it?

78
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,283
Beats me. And right now, I'm more
concerned with the recruitment drive tonight.

79
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:55,493
How many cadets are crazy enough to join
the regiment with the highest casualties?

80
00:06:56,271 --> 00:07:00,762
Hey, Eren! You know if anyone in
your class is thinking about joining us?

81
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,325
Yeah, there're a few.

82
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:06,077
Or, at least, there were.

83
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:08,950
I'm really not so sure now.

84
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:11,336
Fall in!

85
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:17,272
Make ready, people! We're going on patrol.

86
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:18,015
Yes, sir!

87
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:20,846
Good morning, captain! Reporting for duty!

88
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:24,160
Eren. You will stay within ten meters of me at all times.

89
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:28,577
The only reason that you're out of your cell
is because I'm keeping an eye on you. Understood?

90
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:29,339
Yes, sir!

91
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:30,948
Let's ride!

92
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:32,674
Hyah!

93
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,916
Jean! You're really set on the Scouts?

94
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:05,725
Yeah.

95
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:10,596
Whoa, are you serious? I mean. Aren't you terrified?

96
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:14,337
Huh? Of course I'm scared, I'm not an idiot here.

97
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:17,954
Uh. Then why are you...?
Because I am scared of the Titans.

98
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:19,710
And I want to do somethin' about it.

99
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:20,515
Huh?

100
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,731
But listen, I understand that
joining the Scouts isn't for everybody.

101
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,708
I won't guilt trip you.

102
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:29,519
Unlike a certain suicidal maniac.

103
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,995
Eren, huh?

104
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,061
Guess he's already been a
Scout for a while now, hasn't he?

105
00:08:35,377 --> 00:08:40,607
Cadets! Fall in! Head over to the
platform! Time to make your choice! Move it!

106
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:46,262
At the end of the day, there's nothing that anyone
could say to persuade you into risking your life.

107
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:48,217
Same goes for me.

108
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:51,663
So believe me when I say this decision is all mine.

109
00:08:58,092 --> 00:08:59,060
Good evening.

110
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:04,400
I am Erwin Smith, Commander of the Survey
Corp, also known as the Scout Regiment.

111
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:07,086
Today, you will choose your regiment.

112
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:10,532
Let's cut to the chase here. The Scouts need you.

113
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:12,312
We need all the warm bodies we can get.

114
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:18,454
After the recent Titan attack, you now know
first-hand the horrors of which they are capable.

115
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:20,995
As well as the limits of your own skill.

116
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:22,585
However...!

117
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:25,628
This battle's aftermath gave humanity

118
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:28,360
a new chance for victory.

119
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,093
I refer to Eren Jaeger.

120
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:35,559
After selflessly risking life and limb,

121
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:39,936
he has proven, beyond a doubt,
his unwavering loyalty to our cause.

122
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:43,116
Hope lives in him.

123
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:46,634
Eren didn't just help to deter the Titan invasion.

124
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:50,245
He's offered us a means to
discern the truth of their origin!

125
00:09:56,217 --> 00:10:02,118
Intel suggests that the cellar of Jaeger's home in
Shiganshina holds a vital secret regarding our enemy.

126
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:05,617
We will form an expedition to find this secret.

127
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:12,082
Find it. And use it to break free from the Titans'
tyrannical hundred-year reign once and for all!

128
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:15,618
The cellar, huh?

129
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:18,629
Things have progressed this far?

130
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:22,365
If we can figure out what makes 'em
tick, we can hit 'em where it hurts!

131
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,803
I know the Scouts desperately need recruits,

132
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:28,226
but going public with this is out of line!

133
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:31,700
Maybe it's a ploy. A covert strategy?

134
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,526
Question is if he's baited the hook,

135
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:36,870
who does he intend to catch?

136
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:53,922
Before we can reach the
aforementioned cellar in Shiganshina,

137
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:56,218
another problem must be dealt with.

138
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,792
We must first retake Wall Maria.

139
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:02,082
Of course, this is much easier said than done.

140
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:06,619
And now that the gate at Trost
has been rendered inaccessible,

141
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:10,885
we'll be forced to stage future operations
from the Calanath District, further east.

142
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:16,781
Thus, the battalion route we've spent the last four
years establishing is now completely useless to us.

143
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:23,979
Over the course of those four years,
we've incurred losses in excess of 60%.

144
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:28,538
60% in four years. That's a horrifying figure.

145
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,091
One month from now,

146
00:11:32,617 --> 00:11:35,744
we will conduct a recon mission outside the walls.

147
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,137
Recruits from among your ranks
will be expected to take part.

148
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,116
I estimate a third of them will die.

149
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,706
After four years, most will be dead.

150
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,789
But those who endure will be amongst
the most capable soldiers alive.

151
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:55,759
Now having heard this dismal state of affairs,

152
00:11:55,878 --> 00:12:00,406
whoever still wishes to put their life
on the line and join us, remain here.

153
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:05,028
But first ask yourself. Can you give your heart?

154
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:07,974
Can you give everything for humanity?

155
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:14,530
That is all.

156
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,907
Those wanting to join other regiments are dismissed.

157
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:24,176
Commander! I think that you may've
overly intimidated the cadets, sir.

158
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,938
None of them are gonna stick around.

159
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,182
Dammit! C'mon, I've already decided.

160
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:59,466
Stop making me feel like such a fool.

161
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,193
If I don't leave now, I'll
have to go through it all again.

162
00:13:06,012 --> 00:13:09,819
I left my village. The MPs were the whole point.

163
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:12,013
I wanted Mom to be proud.

164
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:13,905
I wanted to be treated right.

165
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,384
Everyone respects them. Period.

166
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,688
But there's no going back.

167
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,151
Not after you've seen it.

168
00:13:22,753 --> 00:13:24,645
Seen them up close, and...

169
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:27,268
Seen how they eat people.

170
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,933
I ask you, if you were ordered to die, could you do it?

171
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:58,824
We don't wanna die, sir.

172
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:03,821
Of course. Let us hope that you don't then.

173
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:10,955
You who stayed, you are now one of us.
Allow me to welcome you to the Scout Regiment.

174
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:13,364
This is a genuine salute, soldiers!

175
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:15,485
Together, we give our hearts!

176
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:17,857
Sir!

177
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:22,443
Everyone.

178
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:26,209
Joined the Scouts. This is so stupid.

179
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,214
This is scary! I just wanna go home.

180
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,485
Ah, man. What the hell?

181
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:39,350
If you're gonna keep crying, then don't stay.

182
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,745
Those of you standing here have worked through your fear.

183
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:46,056
You have proven yourselves courageous.

184
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,907
Each one of you has my respect.

185
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,791
Attention!

186
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:02,043
I'm Section Commander Ness.

187
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:04,140
And this girl is my horse, Charrette.

188
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,969
Fair warning. Charette is rather partial to pulling hair.

189
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,209
So I'd watch out if you don't wanna go bald.

190
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:10,719
We're glad to meetcha.

191
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:13,966
Hey, stop that, ya freak!

192
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:16,018
Can I get a hand here, you guys?

193
00:15:16,112 --> 00:15:18,774
Our training began in earnest the next day.

194
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:22,079
However, the lessons were rarely combat-oriented.

195
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,393
With an emphasis on memorizing Commander
Erwin's long-range scouting formation.

196
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:31,279
Despite being such a precisely detailed,
meticulously calculated formation,

197
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,378
Eren Jaeger's position was somewhat less than clear.

198
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:36,362
You rookies will be here.

199
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:40,082
between the wagon defense squad
and the Scout support squad.

200
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,642
You will run spare horses as well as relay signals.

201
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:50,737
Our Special Ops squad'll be positioned
here, on standby. Behind the center rank.

202
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,136
So we'll be pretty far back then.

203
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,124
It's the safest position in the formation.

204
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:59,674
The supply wagons don't even get such fine treatment.

205
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,210
Our goal this time around is
to simply leave, then come back.

206
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:06,538
Today's expedition will serve as a sort of test run.

207
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:10,171
To see if we've got a shot at
getting you all the way to Shiganshina.

208
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:17,130
Understood. Either way, I still don't really know
how to use my ability or if I can even control it.

209
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:21,659
Eren. Do you understand what the
Commander was asking you about back then?

210
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:22,294
Huh?

211
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,231
Who do you think the real enemy is here?

212
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,778
What did he mean by that? What do you guys think?

213
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:29,008
Not a clue.

214
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:33,987
Well, if I told you that I knew what he
meant, I'd be lying to you. That said I...

215
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:37,995
It's entirely feasible, that this
operation has an alternate goal.

216
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,849
And yet, the Commander has decided it's
best to withhold it from the rank and file.

217
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:47,926
If that's the case, leaving and coming
back is all we need to concern ourselves with.

218
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,820
Have faith in the Commander.

219
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:50,834
I will.

220
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:54,885
Today's training has concluded. Return to base.

221
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:14,818
Whoa. I don't believe it! Oruo! May I be
excused to talk to my friends for a minute?

222
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,561
Fine. Just don't take too long.

223
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:18,679
Hey Mikasa! Armin!

224
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:21,062
Eren!

225
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:23,469
Man, am I glad to see you guys!

226
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:26,798
Eren. Have they mistreated you in any way?

227
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,648
Like subjecting you to any cruel
experiments, or some sort of mental anguish?

228
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,260
No. N-Not at all.

229
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:36,470
That pipsqueak took things way too far.

230
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:38,949
I will make him pay for it one day.

231
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,618
Hold on. You mean Captain Levi?

232
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,605
Hey! Eren!

233
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:44,987
Long time no see!

234
00:17:45,054 --> 00:17:47,504
Oh, hey guys. You're all here!

235
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:49,625
Whoa, wait.

236
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:52,612
If all of you are here, then does that mean...

237
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:55,452
You're saying that you guys all joined the Scouts?

238
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:57,444
Well, yeah. Why else would we be here?

239
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,054
Of course. So then Jean, Annie, and
Marco went to the Military Police then?

240
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:08,629
Wait a sec. You joined, too?

241
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:10,383
Marco is dead.

242
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,126
He what? Wait, what are you saying?

243
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:16,352
Marco's not dead.

244
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,337
You're just kidding around, right?

245
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:22,357
I wish I could tell you he died nobly or heroically.

246
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,528
Truth is, I don't even know how he went out.

247
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:29,406
He died alone. There was no one there to see it happen.

248
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:32,370
Marco's dead.

249
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:37,795
Alright, rookies! Form up!

250
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,352
Your uniforms are here!

251
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,556
So then, you guys are really...

252
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,948
Yes. We will be in the upcoming operation as well.

253
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:28,420
Hey. Eren. I heard that while you were in your Titan form,

254
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:30,605
you intentionally tried to crush Mikasa.

255
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:32,918
You mind telling us what that's all about?

256
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:36,065
You're wrong. He thought he was
just swatting a fly, nothing more.

257
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:37,695
I wasn't asking you.

258
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:42,890
Oh, by the way. That cut on your cheek looks pretty deep.

259
00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:45,662
Just how did you get that, again?

260
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:49,666
Apparently it's all true.

261
00:19:50,214 --> 00:19:53,314
When I was a Titan I... I tried to kill Mikasa.

262
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:56,246
"Apparently?" As in you don't
remember whether you did or not?

263
00:19:56,373 --> 00:20:00,281
So basically, you can transform
into a 14-meter tall monster at will,

264
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,683
but when you do, you don't
actually have full control over it?

265
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:05,954
Not yet. But that's right.

266
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,074
Do you hear that everyone? What a fine situation this is.

267
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:16,903
Our lives and the fate of all
mankind rest on his shoulders.

268
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,412
I'm guessin' we'll probably all end up like Marco,

269
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,511
dead well before Eren even knows it.

270
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:24,417
Stop it! What's the point in chastising Eren now?

271
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:25,689
Just give it a rest.

272
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:31,185
Listen, Mikasa. Unlike you, most of the rest of us

273
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:34,633
aren't willing to just throw
our lives away for him on a whim.

274
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:38,103
We need a reason. The truth.

275
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:40,838
We want to know what we're laying our lives down for.

276
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:44,643
Otherwise, we might hesitate when the time is at hand.

277
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:48,783
What we want is a guarantee from Eren.

278
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:52,421
Show us what you're worth. Prove it to us.

279
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,361
We're asking you to make us
believe that you're worth dying for.

280
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:02,137
You think you can do that?

281
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:07,571
If you can, then we're with you. All the way!

282
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:09,962
Right.

283
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,282
Commander. The time approaches.

284
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,423
Titans in the vicinity have been lured away!

285
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:26,320
Gate opens in thirty seconds!

286
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:34,831
Awesome, it's the Scouts!

287
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:38,272
See that symbol? They call it the Wings of Freedom!

288
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:39,994
So cool!

289
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:46,637
This is it! The day has come for
humanity to take another step forward!

290
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:50,300
Now let's show those Titans exactly what we're made of!

291
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:53,921
Open the gate!

292
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:08,389
Forward!

293
00:22:12,253 --> 00:22:16,374
It's officially begun. The 57th Recon Mission!

294
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:19,614
Scouts, move out!

295
00:23:54,571 --> 00:24:00,000
The Scout Regiment takes up its long-range scouting
formation, and begins to make progress beyond the wall.

296
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:02,674
Their efforts, however, come to an abrupt halt.

297
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:07,714
A new foe presents itself. An
enigmatic Titan displaying intelligence.
