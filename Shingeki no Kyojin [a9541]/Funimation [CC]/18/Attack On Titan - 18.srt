1
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:08,087
It's officially begun. The 57th Recon Mission!

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,335
Scouts, move out!

3
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:18,627
Intel suggests that the cellar
of Jaeger's home in Shiganshina

4
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:21,170
holds a vital secret regarding our enemy.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,674
That's our destination.

6
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:27,762
You rookies will be here. Between the

7
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:31,580
wagon defense squad and the Scout support squad.

8
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,465
You will run spare horses, as well as relay signals.

9
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:38,055
Beyond that will be uninterrupted Titan territory.

10
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:40,073
We'll be more or less on our own.

11
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:44,506
The only thing to fall back on out there is
Commander Erwin's long-range scouting formation.

12
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:47,071
The special ops squad will be positioned here.

13
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,190
We're not dealing with an Abnormal.
This thing's showing intelligence!

14
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:03,382
Like the Colossal.

15
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:05,073
Like Eren!

16
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:08,361
It's a human being wrapped in a Titan body!

17
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,704
The moves on this one, she's like a damn athlete!

18
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:16,683
We are so screwed!

19
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:20,951
What? She's protecting her weak spot?

20
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:23,398
Damn it! There's nothing I can do.

21
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:27,442
Jean! Don't let that suicidal maniac die in vain!

22
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:30,215
Why did she stop?

23
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,529
She did it! She's the one who killed him!

24
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:36,642
I told him the right wing was
suicide but he went along anyway!

25
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:38,881
And how he's dead, thanks to her!

26
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,703
Oh no.

27
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:56,329
Odds are that bought the platoon more than enough time.

28
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:58,878
I say we follow suit, and get outta here!

29
00:01:58,949 --> 00:02:01,865
What? Wait. No.

30
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:06,712
She's... She's going for Eren!

31
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:53,229
Where'd they get this? How old's your gear?

32
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:57,273
Don't worry about it. It came off like
it's supposed to, so it didn't break.

33
00:03:57,392 --> 00:03:58,871
Should still be in decent shape.

34
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:01,469
All right. That's something, then.

35
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:03,670
Still down a horse, though.

36
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,696
Not an ideal situation.

37
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:10,019
We can't get movin' again until Jean's ride shows up.

38
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,070
Just my luck.

39
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:15,871
Reiner's horse comes back like an old lover.

40
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,329
Why the hell's mine gotta go AWOL?

41
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:26,300
Damn it. We can't afford to
stay out in the open like this.

42
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:31,209
If worse comes to worse, one
of us'll have to get left behind.

43
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:35,016
What are we supposed to do? Draw straws?

44
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:40,768
Armin's hurt. Reiner's too big to ride with safely.

45
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:45,376
Maybe I should just take my
chances horse-retrieving on foot.

46
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:48,921
Dammit!

47
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,359
How messed up is it that we might
even have to even consider that?

48
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:54,466
Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

49
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,015
It's what we get for narrowly escaping death.

50
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:15,638
Armin.

51
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,667
You with me?

52
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,329
I guess your head's still a little shaken up, huh?

53
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,236
Um. I might still be a little foggy, yeah.

54
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:30,772
It's okay. The choice isn't gonna be
any easier with you thinkin' clearly.

55
00:05:31,224 --> 00:05:33,029
One of us is gonna have to stay here.

56
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:34,515
We need to figure out who.

57
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:41,544
Wait a sec! I mean shouldn't we at
least fire off a smoke signal first?

58
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,641
If everyone kept going straight,

59
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:47,314
Row Four, Squad Three ought to
be in close proximity to us by now.

60
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:54,037
Well, that's the emergency signal, but who knows?

61
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:58,255
I doubt anyone's gonna see it and think,
"Hey, somebody must need an extra horse."

62
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:01,194
Armin. Listen. We only wait three minutes.

63
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:03,737
If no one shows, we have to decide who stays.

64
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:05,133
It should be me.

65
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,502
But, if I'm going to be left out here in
the open, I need you to relay a message.

66
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,205
If possible, give it only to Commander Erwin.

67
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:14,204
Hang on, Armin!

68
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:16,525
Looks like you'll be able to tell him yourself.

69
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:19,314
Someone answered the call!

70
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,624
Hell yes!

71
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:22,134
They've got two horses in tow!

72
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:22,777
Huh?

73
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,301
Whoa, that's...

74
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,022
It's Christa!

75
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:32,658
Hey guys, you alright?

76
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:37,866
Well, damn! That's my li'l runaway!

77
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:42,116
Easy, Buchwald. It's okay. I forgive you.

78
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:45,334
Poor thing. He ran to me like the devil was on his tail.

79
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,567
So did you guys fight a Titan?

80
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,531
Oh, no! Armin, your head! You've been hurt!

81
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:54,015
It's nothing. Promise.

82
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:58,259
I'm impressed someone actually
answered our distress signal.

83
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,430
Well I wasn't far away, so. That and I found the horse.

84
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,728
A lot of people wouldn't have risked the trek over here.

85
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,833
You're as noble as the steeds you tame.

86
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:08,509
We're all in your debt.

87
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:11,027
It was nothing.

88
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:15,119
I'm just... I'm just glad that you're all okay.

89
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,708
What would we do without you?

90
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:24,565
She's an angel.

91
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:25,938
A goddess.

92
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:28,069
One day, my wife.

93
00:07:28,872 --> 00:07:31,955
Okay. I suppose we'd better rejoin the formation.

94
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:34,338
Yeah! They'll order a retreat any minute now!

95
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,837
I'll just say it. I'm glad we survived,

96
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:41,545
but heading back after only an hour?

97
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:44,007
Not really something to be proud of, if you ask me.

98
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:49,011
And while we're on the subject, is anybody else
curious why she's headed away from the command squad?

99
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:49,871
She?

100
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:54,272
Green smoke?

101
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:57,236
Looks like we're not heading back after all,

102
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:58,657
just changing course.

103
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:02,144
Yeah, but that doesn't make sense!

104
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:04,793
What the hell? Is Commander Erwin out of his mind?

105
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:08,398
Every one of us has the authority
to declare the mission failed.

106
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,518
Why isn't anyone speaking up?

107
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:14,378
Is the command squad too far ahead to see their signals?

108
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,781
Possibly. But either way, I think our course is clear.

109
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,878
Assume command's got this.

110
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,507
Smoke signals. Green.

111
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:32,017
Oruo, pass it on.

112
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,581
With pleasure, sir!

113
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:37,238
Things seem to be going pretty smoothly for the moment.

114
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:41,465
Still. I wonder how it really is.

115
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:45,126
My gut tells me the frontline's
already taken a serious hit.

116
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,471
Reporting, sir!

117
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:51,166
An oral message! It appears the
right-wing spotters have been wiped out!

118
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,614
The early warning network is compromised.

119
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:56,537
One of you will need to relay the message down the line.

120
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:58,309
You heard the man, Petra.

121
00:08:58,843 --> 00:08:59,382
 Go on.

122
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:00,396
Sir!

123
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:05,954
The right wing? That's where Armin's positioned!

124
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:09,408
Still. He wasn't with the outliers.

125
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:11,751
He and the others were more toward the center.

126
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:14,674
Surely the Titans haven't made it that far in?

127
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:17,518
Black smoke?

128
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,694
An Abnormal!

129
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:21,676
Eren. Fire the signal.

130
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:23,262
Yes, sir.

131
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,119
This is a disgrace. Lotta good the formation
does if the bastards can bore into it that deeply.

132
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:34,068
So close. Too close.

133
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:37,324
Just under that smoke, someone...

134
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:39,213
someone's fighting.

135
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:52,621
Damn it.

136
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:56,829
I'm right in front of you! Look down, you monster!

137
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:02,613
Now!

138
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:16,293
We've got you now! You're clever, but I'd like
to see you defend all three weak spots at once!

139
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:19,798
Cut the Achilles' Heel! The spinal cord!

140
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:23,879
Whatever brings the bitch to her knees! Attack!

141
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,124
For the soldiers you've killed!

142
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:29,457
We're gonna make sure this hurts!

143
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:36,985
She jumped?

144
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:53,397
Put me down! Put me down!

145
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,079
I have to tell the others!

146
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,356
She can't be allowed to take anyone else by surprise!

147
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,299
The platoon will be decimated!

148
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:35,942
An Abnormal?

149
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:39,168
This far in? Let's take it out!

150
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:41,529
We can't let it make any more headway!

151
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:02,984
Well if the right wing's been all but
annihilated, why in the hell aren't we retreating?

152
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,489
Don't know! Commander's orders!

153
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:08,013
Just keep the message moving left!

154
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,826
So what's the story?

155
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:21,301
How far's the commander gonna let us run off course?

156
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:25,574
Your guess is as good as mine. We
should be heading south, not east.

157
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,451
This is crazy. We'll run right into the damn thing!

158
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,858
Yeah. And look up ahead.

159
00:12:32,402 --> 00:12:33,693
Just what we need.

160
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,404
Titans have used this path.

161
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,450
Lack of vegetation's a giveaway.

162
00:13:01,507 --> 00:13:03,669
It should be a cinch for the wagons.

163
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:10,805
Inform everyone behind us. Only the center
wagon defense squad is to enter this forest.

164
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:11,892
Yes, sir!

165
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,087
Excuse me, sir. It looks as though the center rank

166
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:31,543
is heading straight into the forest.

167
00:13:31,772 --> 00:13:34,800
Won't we run smack dab into the trees if we follow them?

168
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:37,485
We'll go around.

169
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:39,711
Um. Yes, sir!

170
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:44,073
You're kidding me.

171
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:46,543
We on a sight-seeing tour now or what?

172
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:49,419
How much further they want us to stray off course?

173
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,109
This is ridiculous!

174
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:54,972
Bizarre. But so be it.

175
00:13:55,023 --> 00:13:57,197
Commander Erwin must have something in mind.

176
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:00,206
Perhaps the situation compels him to improvise.

177
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:02,209
That gives me a lot of confidence.

178
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,849
Maybe he's looking for a nice, shady spot
to throw all the rookies a celebratory picnic.

179
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:09,520
Uh. I rather doubt that.

180
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:14,071
Lighten up. Point is, I'm praying
he doesn't intend for us to camp here.

181
00:14:14,222 --> 00:14:16,437
Not with that Female Titan on our ass.

182
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:19,331
We'd be sittin' ducks. He's got to know that.

183
00:14:19,856 --> 00:14:22,325
Yeah, we're just passing through
on the way to somewhere else;

184
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,755
no one in his right mind would make us stop here.

185
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:26,636
All soldiers, halt!

186
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,764
Alright, rookies! Listen up!

187
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:34,822
We're assuming intercept position within the trees!

188
00:14:35,006 --> 00:14:37,334
Unsheathe and find a perch!

189
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:39,979
If any Titans attempt to enter the forest,

190
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:42,076
stop them, whatever it takes!

191
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:45,354
Uh... Excuse me, sir? What exactly is the...

192
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:46,946
I've given you an order!

193
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,678
Okay. What the hell's going on?

194
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:03,362
So. Hey. Only the center rank
is going into the forest then?

195
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:05,348
What about the formation?

196
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:07,398
Apparently it's breaking up.

197
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:09,979
The path isn't wide enough for the side ranks.

198
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:13,174
We have to go around. It's the only tactical option.

199
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,915
Even if it means we're useless as spotters.

200
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:19,544
But couldn't we have just avoided the forest altogether?

201
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:23,231
The commander misread a map
and realize it too late, or what?

202
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:27,759
No clue. Maybe we're here to shake
the threat that's been on our right.

203
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:31,375
The trees make a decent cover, I suppose. Maybe.

204
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,211
Do you believe this B.S.?

205
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:47,154
Am I the only one who wonders what happened
with the whole "logistics base," thing?

206
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:50,689
Or why we didn't go galloping home
after the Female Titan showed up?

207
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:53,853
Why're we suddenly all playing birdhouse?

208
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,797
Oh wait, no. I know the last one.

209
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:01,072
No, Titans allowed in the center rank's nature retreat.

210
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:07,405
Fool. He's got no idea what's going on.

211
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:09,041
He'll hear you.

212
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:14,009
What do I care? He's not explaining anything
to the ones risking their lives. Look at him.

213
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:17,241
He acts all calm and in control,
but you can see he's petrified.

214
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:18,471
What do you mean?

215
00:16:18,672 --> 00:16:23,058
They say when officers in the field are deemed
incompetent by their men they can be relieved of duty.

216
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:27,457
Or in more extreme cases, they can die
from mysterious stab wounds to the back.

217
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,628
I suppose there's all kinds of
accidents that could happen out here.

218
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:34,266
Hold on. Whatever you're thinking of doing...

219
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:39,112
Look, I'm just talkin'. The whole
situation's screwed and I need to vent, alright?

220
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:44,069
I'm not gonna start a mutiny. Well, not yet anyway.

221
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,437
Just answer me this.

222
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:51,950
You agree with this strategy
or is it a bunch of crap? Really.

223
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,954
'Cause you look like you know something I don't.

224
00:16:56,073 --> 00:16:57,249
Well, um.

225
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,214
5-meter Titan approaching!

226
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:10,192
Why did the commander opt to bring us here?

227
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:14,728
I can't make sense of it. What was he thinking?

228
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:16,865
No. That's wrong.

229
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,288
That's not the question I should be asking.

230
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:22,125
The real puzzle is this:

231
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,749
if the Female Titan is in fact pursuing Eren,

232
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:29,697
does Erwin know? Is that why we're here?

233
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,177
Captain! Captain Levi!

234
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:34,653
What?

235
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:37,816
C'mon, sir! We're in a forest!

236
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:41,082
We won't see a Titan 'til it's right on top of us!

237
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,275
The center rank's totally cut off!

238
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:45,891
Something's coming up on the right, isn't it?

239
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,765
So what are we supposed to do?

240
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:50,291
Avoid Titans or defend the wagons?

241
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:53,295
Quit whining and move on from the obvious already.

242
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:55,997
Neither of those is an option anymore.

243
00:17:57,274 --> 00:17:58,657
Wha...? What are you talking about?

244
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:00,660
Haven't you noticed what's arond you?

245
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,321
Take a look at these big ass trees.

246
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,812
Perfect environment for ODM gear, wouldn't you say?

247
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:14,278
Take my advice, Eren. Calm down and use your head.

248
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:17,201
The best survival tool is your brain.

249
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:19,306
Yes, sir!

250
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:26,234
He's right. I'm new to this, so virtually
everything about it's gonna throw me for a loop.

251
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,848
Simple answers are for children.

252
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,279
Only way to learn is by doing.

253
00:18:31,797 --> 00:18:33,902
If I want to cut it with these guys,

254
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:36,731
I've gotta stop cryin' to be spoon-fed.

255
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:40,561
Doesn't make sense. What are we doing here?

256
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,013
There's gotta be a reason.

257
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,913
I mean they know, right? They gotta!

258
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,741
Huh?

259
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,275
Wait. Are we all in the dark here?

260
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,962
What the hell's going on? Really?

261
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:58,888
Does that mean, even Captain Levi's clueless?

262
00:19:01,113 --> 00:19:03,287
Break it down to its simplest elements.

263
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:06,062
If the Titan really is after Eren, then...

264
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:08,812
there's only one reason for our being here.

265
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:12,798
Commander Erwin knows, and he intends to confront her!

266
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:13,729
Armin.

267
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:20,362
Bear with me. Our orders are
to keep Titans out, right? Right?

268
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:25,899
So, I mean. We don't actually need to fight them.

269
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,615
Yeah? Am I wrong?

270
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:04,606
Black smoke!

271
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,435
It's right behind us!

272
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,937
Damn thing's been on our ass since we came in here.

273
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,336
Blades drawn. Now.

274
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:18,004
It'll happen in the blink of an eye. Be ready.

275
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,238
Go! Move it!

276
00:20:58,714 --> 00:20:59,960
Holy shit!

277
00:21:00,062 --> 00:21:02,982
How the hell are we supposed to
pull evasive maneuvers in here?

278
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:04,119
It's catchin' up!

279
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:06,697
Captain! Engage the ODM gear?

280
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:08,160
Captain?

281
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:11,720
Where you goin'?

282
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,641
Rear Reinforcements!

283
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:31,747
Captain! Your orders!

284
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:34,093
It's dangerous! Let's take it out!

285
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:36,642
Tell us to engage, sir!

286
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,502
I'll cut the bitch!

287
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:42,276
Stupid creature!

288
00:21:42,443 --> 00:21:44,762
You're racing full speed to your own death!

289
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:48,728
You're chasing the best damn
team of Titan-slayers in existence!

290
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:52,469
Captain?

291
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,466
Captain!

292
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:57,093
We need your orders, sir!

293
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:59,803
She's gaining on us! Let's just take her out!

294
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,394
That's the whole reason we're here, isn't it?

295
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:03,341
Right, sir?

296
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:04,286
Captain!

297
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,317
Your orders, sir! Please!

298
00:22:09,482 --> 00:22:11,729
Everyone cover your ears. Now.

299
00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:12,849
Huh?

300
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:58,619
The Female Titan's chase leaves
a trail of bloodshed in its wake.

301
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:04,039
Eren flees in horror, watching as
his comrades die right before his eyes.

302
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:07,134
The chaos forces a decision.
