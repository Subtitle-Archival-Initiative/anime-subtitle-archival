1
00:00:02,356 --> 00:00:03,952
What choice do we have?

2
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:07,058
The world is a cruel place.

3
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:19,940
I swore... to kill them all!

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,666
Every last one!

5
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:28,633
And just like that...

6
00:00:29,348 --> 00:00:31,390
everything changed.

7
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:37,300
At that terrible moment, in our hearts, we knew.

8
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:43,528
Home was a pen. Humanity... cattle.

9
00:00:58,889 --> 00:00:59,799
Eren!

10
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,690
Eren...

11
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:44,368
Brothers and sisters.

12
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,281
Let us pray for the continued
strength of saints Maria, Rose, and Sina.

13
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:52,632
May they stand firm.

14
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:56,255
Their grace is a manifestation of our good faith...

15
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:59,686
We give thanks to the light of the Divine Architect.

16
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,847
He whose wisdom is the mortar;

17
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:06,549
whose sublime love for His
creation is the steadfast stone.

18
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:12,884
He, and he alone, protects us from the
Titan scourge, in proportion to our worship.

19
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:17,023
Verily... Innocence and obedience are all He asks...

20
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:28,592
No! Impossible!

21
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:43,862
Dear God! Please! Not the wall!

22
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:46,315
Stay away!

23
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:10,574
Well I daresay it looks like our
boy's in control of himself this time.

24
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:15,679
Yeah. Still, though... there's no guarantee this
will turn out any differently than their last meeting.

25
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,285
Come on, he wouldn't have transformed...
unless he knew he could take her this time...

26
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:22,334
he's got this, okay?

27
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:25,926
I don't doubt that. But determination
alone isn't enough to win a fight.

28
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,880
You of all people should know that.

29
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,805
It'll take more than that to beat Annie.

30
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:33,368
A lot more.

31
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:36,142
Damn it!

32
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:39,424
She's making a break for level ground!

33
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:41,219
So much for our gear! What now?

34
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,177
Split into two teams and go around!

35
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,359
Understood!

36
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,305
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

37
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,814
Son of a... Where'd they come from?

38
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:18,456
Annie... Always so cynical...

39
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:21,659
Like every little thing around you was pointless.

40
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:25,870
Nothing worth a second look.

41
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:32,480
Every now and then, though, I could see through the act...

42
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:36,087
Especially when you were showing off your fighting skills.

43
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:41,950
Maybe hand-to-hand combat didn't count for
squat against our final grade back at the academy...

44
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:46,176
But to you? It was a different story altogether.

45
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:49,640
Yeah... about that much at least.

46
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:52,357
It was obvious you were a liar.

47
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,519
Fighting's your whole world,

48
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:58,340
but what exactly are you fighting for?

49
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:02,923
What could possibly have been
worth all this death and destruction?!

50
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:27,306
Oh, god...

51
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:31,668
Section Commander, I hate to say it, but the
city'll be debris and corpses before long...

52
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:33,606
even if we manage to catch her.

53
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:35,275
Well, then that's how it's gonna be!

54
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:37,707
We're sticking to Commander Erwin's plan, got it?

55
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:39,900
So stop babbling and ready the nets.

56
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:40,701
Right.

57
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,602
Eren...

58
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,581
We didn't sign up for this.

59
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:52,372
They... They didn't say there'd
be Titans fighting in the streets.

60
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,478
No kidding. This is crazy.

61
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:58,125
We've got two of 'em hashing it out in the streets?

62
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,117
Yes, sir.

63
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:01,643
The city's collapsing like a house of cards.

64
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,186
It's just... It's horrifying...

65
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:06,395
We can only guess how many casualties...

66
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:11,367
Erwin! Your arrogance has brought Hell right to our door!

67
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:12,820
I know.

68
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:18,763
I acted entirely on my own authority.

69
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,335
And I offer no excuses.

70
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:28,226
You knew what this would do to us, you son of a bitch!

71
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:30,308
You knew and our lives be damned!

72
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:32,730
Why? Damn you, why?

73
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,871
For humanity.

74
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,216
For victory.

75
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:43,416
Don't give me that!

76
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:45,411
You're nothing but a traitor!

77
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,452
I ought to kill you right here and now!

78
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:49,437
None of the higher ups would fault me!

79
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:52,972
Do as your conscience dictates.

80
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:54,764
My post is yours.

81
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:57,376
The Female Titan must not escape.

82
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:59,045
Deployment is through Peer

83
00:07:59,322 --> 00:08:01,428
and Beirer is in command of Provisions.

84
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:03,238
Work with them closely.

85
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,018
Do whatever is required to ensure she doesn't...

86
00:08:05,043 --> 00:08:05,693
Shut up!

87
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,041
Do... Do you really believe...

88
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,029
...this is for the good of us all?

89
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:15,070
I have faith it's a step forward.

90
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,639
Everyone, lower your rifles.

91
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:24,985
Place this man under arrest.

92
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,494
Sir!

93
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,712
Deploy all troops immediately.

94
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:32,374
As of now... focus on evacuation.

95
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:33,430
Yes, Sir!

96
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:39,461
Erwin... I hereby wash my hands of
you and leave you to the high court.

97
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:42,592
I'll accept their judgment. Thank you, Nile.

98
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:45,539
Levi. For now, stay here.

99
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:47,431
A pointless death wouldn't suit you.

100
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:49,681
No, I doubt it would...

101
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,435
Any more than it suits anyone else.

102
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,934
To rise above monsters,

103
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:03,873
we have to abandon our humanity.

104
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:07,392
What we fight, we become...

105
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:12,430
...fire with fire.

106
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:19,429
Look at her. Annie can do it.

107
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:26,658
Annie...

108
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:29,623
Annie!

109
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,263
Annie...

110
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,316
I believe in you.

111
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:58,082
I'm always on your side.

112
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:20,009
I... will... kill them...

113
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:23,900
 Every last one!

114
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,259
Eren!

115
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:53,738
What is he...?

116
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:55,454
Help him!

117
00:10:55,525 --> 00:11:00,023
No! With the state he's in, it's
probably best that we keep our distance.

118
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:18,354
God.

119
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:47,614
She's headed up the wall!

120
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,122
She's trying to escape!

121
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:05,084
No, no, no! We can't let her get away!

122
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,726
I won't let her!

123
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,338
It's over, Annie.

124
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:27,893
Now fall.

125
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:37,515
Annie...

126
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:40,724
I'm so sorry.

127
00:12:42,473 --> 00:12:44,649
I don't expect you to forgive me.

128
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,949
But... please...

129
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,332
please just...

130
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:58,512
Stand your ground. Stand your ground

131
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,398
even if the whole world stands against you.

132
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:09,381
Die... All of you... Everything...

133
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,073
They'll despise you...

134
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,322
They won't understand.

135
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:17,456
But I will. Your dad always will.

136
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:21,753
Oh, no! He's gonna devour her whole!

137
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:23,247
Eren! Back off!

138
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:24,266
Don't do it!

139
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:27,751
This... is freedom!

140
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:30,994
Promise me you'll return...

141
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:33,939
That's all I ask.

142
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,432
Wha... What's he doing?

143
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,354
Son of a...?

144
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,754
They're merging?

145
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:12,518
Stop it, Eren!

146
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:22,595
It's not a good idea to eat our key evidence...

147
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:23,975
you idiot.

148
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:13,208
Eren.

149
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,570
Mikasa... Is Annie...?

150
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:34,645
Damn it! All the shit we've been
through and this is what we get?

151
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:37,528
Annie! Wake up!

152
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:40,350
C'mon, face the music! You owe us!

153
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:44,004
Don't be a coward! I know you can hear me!

154
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:47,110
That's enough.

155
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,191
It's over.

156
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:57,297
Someone get me a wire net!

157
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,714
This thing belongs deep underground!

158
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:00,817
Understood!

159
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:04,013
What have we done?

160
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:08,891
If we can't get any answers out of
her, then what was the point of all this?

161
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:12,556
We're left with nothing but countless casualties,

162
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:15,488
ruined lives, and unanswered questions.

163
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:17,249
All for what?

164
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:29,778
Well, it was a valiant effort.

165
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:31,541
Can't win 'em all though, right?

166
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,328
Right.

167
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,865
At the very least the Scout Regiment's been exonerated.

168
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,557
Sure, by the skin of its teeth, but still.

169
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,815
Let's hope the brass agrees.

170
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:56,248
As you might imagine, we have many questions.

171
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,562
If the target's identity was beyond all doubt,

172
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:03,947
why would you neglect to request
aid from the Military Police?

173
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:08,794
Discretion. We had reason to believe she was
operating in conjunction with other insiders.

174
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:13,203
I felt it was necessary to involve
only those well above suspicion, sir.

175
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,914
Yes. And the price of your "discretion"
was the near obliteration of Stohess.

176
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:18,661
Well done.

177
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:21,409
I didn't foresee the damage's scale, sir.

178
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,325
Blame my incompetence.

179
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:25,183
Blame isn't going to rebuild my roof!

180
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,965
If the Female Titan were left to roam
free... the wall was subject to breach...

181
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,716
and the damage to Stohess
would've been beyond devastating.

182
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:33,200
Perhaps.

183
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:34,311
Erwin...

184
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:37,672
You have me grasping at straws to exonerate you...

185
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:41,606
What I need is proof that your
tactics yielded some manner of benefit.

186
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:45,285
Granted, Annie Leonhart is rendered innocuous,

187
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:47,672
but also essentially useless.

188
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:49,820
Yes, sir. That she is.

189
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:51,553
Are you saying...

190
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:54,167
it was all for nothing...?

191
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:00,753
Hey.

192
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,524
You feel okay?

193
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:14,560
Yeah...

194
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,850
In fact it's weird how "okay" I feel.

195
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:24,031
So, is... Annie still stuck in that thing?

196
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:25,461
Uh-huh.

197
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:31,339
Yeah... You'd think after all we sacrificed to
get her back, fate would cut us a little slack.

198
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:34,969
It's humbling, knowing how far
she'll go to keep her secrets.

199
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,116
Humbling? More like infuriating.

200
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:40,824
Why'd you let her go, Eren?

201
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:47,102
You did... didn't you?

202
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:49,747
You gave her an out.

203
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:54,676
I know. I didn't mean to, I...

204
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:57,734
I just couldn't help it.

205
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:02,995
When I saw her face, I just froze...

206
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:09,134
Armin Arlelt. And Jean Kirschtein...

207
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,811
You two are up first.

208
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:11,517
Yes, sir.

209
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,329
Debriefing time.

210
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:15,049
See you later, I guess.

211
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:15,936
Sure.

212
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:32,111
Honestly... It felt kinda... good.

213
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,821
Just letting go...

214
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:37,886
my body, my mind, everything...

215
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:41,007
For a minute it was almost...

216
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,805
like I wanted to die...

217
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,337
Eren, stop it!

218
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:49,589
Don't worry, I'm better now.

219
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:01,524
I'm glad...

220
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:04,535
I'm glad you're back...

221
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,543
I can't get my head wrapped around it.

222
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:16,404
This whole fighting fire with fire business or whatever.

223
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:19,326
Is that really the only option we've got?

224
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:23,331
Not necessarily. Just the only
one that's presented itself.

225
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:26,486
And now we know Eren can do it.

226
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:33,438
Yeah, well... if it's that easy for
the fight to turn us all into monsters...

227
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:36,760
...then maybe we don't deserve to win.

228
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:48,611
Go on.

229
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:10,110
No one ever promised us we'd come out of this unscathed.

230
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:18,080
For nothing? I believe this latest tragedy
has moved us forward by leaps and bounds, sir.

231
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:26,580
Not long ago, we hadn't even imagined the
possibility of humans transforming into Titans.

232
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:29,381
Now, we're not only aware of the enemy in our midst...

233
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,317
we've managed to capture one of them.

234
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:33,714
Make no mistake, there are more out there.

235
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,743
And we will hunt down every last one.

236
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,342
The initiative is ours.

237
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:40,772
Starting now...

238
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,553
we launch an attack on the Titans within our walls!

239
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:54,310
The Scout Regiment's recall to the capital
and Eren's incarceration were rescinded.

240
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,672
Instead, they were charged with
guarding Annie Leonhart in her holding cell

241
00:21:58,736 --> 00:22:02,691
deep underground, where they
kept strict vigil day and night.

242
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:04,881
Sadly, however...

243
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,143
it would take a far longer time...

244
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:09,749
and cost a great many more lives...

245
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:12,331
for humanity to discover the true nature...

246
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:14,500
of what it held captive.
