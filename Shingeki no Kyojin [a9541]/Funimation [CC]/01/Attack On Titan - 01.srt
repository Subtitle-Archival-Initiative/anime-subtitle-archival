1
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,995
And just like that.

2
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:30,808
Everything changed.

3
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:41,071
At that terrible moment, in our hearts, we knew.

4
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:47,101
Home was a pen; humanity, cattle.

5
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:01,091
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

6
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:07,920
Moment of truth, people! It's on us!

7
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:12,891
Either we secure this ground as mankind's
first stronghold beyond the walls, or we die!

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,710
Target approaching!

9
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:23,008
Split into five groups, now!

10
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,626
Group one will act as the bait!

11
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:29,825
All squadrons, engage omni-directional mobility gear!

12
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,534
Hit it from every angle!

13
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:57,118
Ahhhhhh!

14
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,481
For my brothers! For humanity!

15
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:10,369
Mikasa. Hey.

16
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,322
We should get back.

17
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,512
Um, where are we exactly?

18
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:19,434
Try asking me again when you're awake.

19
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:23,391
I'm up, I... I just... I dunno.

20
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,880
It's like the dream I was having went on forever.

21
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:31,528
It's gone now. What was it about?

22
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,815
Eren, have... Have you been crying?

23
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:53,017
Harken! These walls are a bulwark gifted by God!

24
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,091
Riven rock? Stone? Mortar? No, my brethren!

25
00:04:57,524 --> 00:05:01,685
They are bastions of faith! The will of heaven manifest!

26
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:08,187
Do me a favor, huh? Don't let anyone know I was crying.

27
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:13,574
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Still, though.
You don't even remember why?

28
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,209
Might want have your dad look into that.

29
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:19,602
Right, 'cause tearing up is usually a medical thing.

30
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,774
Somebody messin' with you?

31
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,345
Hey Mr. Hannes.

32
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:28,042
Or you just get on Mikasa's bad side?

33
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:31,035
No! What are you even talking about?

34
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,419
Ugh! You smell like a tavern!

35
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:36,269
If only tears were cups of ale.

36
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:38,072
Of course.

37
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:40,001
You kids care for a swig?

38
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:42,751
Aren't you, uh, on watch?

39
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:45,288
Yup! Watchin' the ol' gate we are.

40
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:50,437
Thirsty work, playin' sentry. Pinochle
only goes so far to chase off the boredom.

41
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:56,542
Li'l nip now and then keeps us all in our
courage for a spell. Perks of being a guard, eh?

42
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,267
How do you expect to fight if
you're so loose on your feet?

43
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:03,403
Huh? Now why on earth would I have to fight?

44
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,151
Why do you think? What if they break through the walls?

45
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:08,385
We'd be sitting ducks on your watch!

46
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:15,792
Eren. Kid. Please. Use your inside voice.

47
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,334
The doc's kid has some fire in him!

48
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:24,582
Listen, the only thing they've done to the
wall in the past hundred years is scratch at it.

49
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:29,146
I have the feelin' if they get it in their big heads
to do somethin' else, we'll be more 'n ready for 'em.

50
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,238
A feeling? What have any of you
actually done to be ready for 'em?

51
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,881
Dad says you've gotta stay sharp!

52
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:38,099
Ah, good Doctor Jaeger. Yeah, well.

53
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:42,515
Can't argue with a man who
single-handedly spared us from the plague.

54
00:06:43,716 --> 00:06:45,876
Thing is, he's talkin' about his scalpel.

55
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:48,681
What we do isn't half as important.

56
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:52,950
Hey, no disrespect to your father, but a soldier's time

57
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,690
beyond the wall kinda tends to put the
whole issue into a different perspective.

58
00:06:57,048 --> 00:07:01,792
You see 'em groping around out there, mindless, dead-eyed.

59
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:06,541
Wait a minute. Sounds to me like you
don't even think they're all that dangerous.

60
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:07,763
Eh.

61
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:14,835
Oh great! Then at least have the decency to stop calling
yourselves a garrison; people might get the wrong idea!

62
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,669
Good point.

63
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:23,773
Look at it this way, huh? If a garrison's actually
doing what people think it oughta, we're up a creek.

64
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:27,143
Personally I take a lot of
stock in being called a freeloader,

65
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:31,147
it means things are good. It's
how I can measure peace of mind.

66
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:40,362
Good? We live in a cage. All we do is eat and sleep.

67
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:44,080
That's it. End of story.

68
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:46,948
We have the peace of mind of livestock.

69
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:52,550
Man, you were right about the kid havin' fire!

70
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,337
Careful not to cry it out.

71
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:56,839
You coming back to the game or what?

72
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,545
Yeah.

73
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,375
Hey! Where you goin'?

74
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,787
The mouth on that kid.

75
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,496
He's just a kid.

76
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,386
Tends to dream bigger than life really wants him to.

77
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:22,330
Eren. You should let the Scout Regiment thing go.

78
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:26,110
Seriously? Why does everybody think they're a joke?

79
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,891
What people think about 'em isn't really the issue.

80
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,948
Perfect timing! They're back!

81
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:42,565
We can make it if we hurry.
Get a move on! I want a good view!

82
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,607
Argh. Can't see squat.

83
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:28,179
Sure taken a hit, haven't they?

84
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:34,935
Yeah. Rest of 'em got eaten. That's what
happens when pride takes you outside the walls.

85
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,177
Moses? Moses?

86
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:42,275
Beg your pardon. Where is my
son? He should be with you all.

87
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:44,555
Oh, please tell me he made it!

88
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:49,147
I wish I had better news. Give it to her.

89
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:18,367
I'm sorry. It's all that was left of him.

90
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:39,112
He... He did good, yes? He was brave?

91
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:44,017
Tell me my son stood his ground to the bitter end.

92
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,454
That his death meant something!

93
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:50,847
Tell me his sacrifice gave us a better chance!

94
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:57,335
He was brave!

95
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,122
But. His sacrifice meant nothing.

96
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:09,173
So with all our losses. It's ever the same.

97
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:15,709
The day was lost! We have nothing!

98
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:21,052
Your son died because of me! I sent him to his death!

99
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:23,927
I sent all of them to their deaths!

100
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:26,153
And there's nothing to show for it!

101
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:29,742
All of it amounts to nothing!

102
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,010
Uplifting, huh.

103
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:37,192
Oh, sure.

104
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:42,784
Nothing like seeing our hard-earned taxes go toward
keeping those bastards fat and happy on human gristle.

105
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:47,161
You little punk!

106
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,183
What are you doing? Let me go!

107
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:54,931
Yeah, that's right! You'd better run!

108
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:58,687
Alright, I get it! Stop already!

109
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:08,324
Oh great! Firewood everywhere! Perfect!

110
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:14,419
So. Are you still bound and determined
to become one of them? The Scouts?

111
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:24,198
Just help me pick these up.

112
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,456
Like there was much to begin with.

113
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,339
Hey, we're home.

114
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:49,661
Welcome back, kids.

115
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,368
Wow. Somebody worked hard to keep
us in fuel for the next several days.

116
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,145
Eh. Whatever.

117
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:02,792
What was that for?

118
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,123
Your earlobe's red, which means
you've got something to hide.

119
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,776
Mikasa helped you again, now didn't she?

120
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,763
Hey. Where you off to, Dad?

121
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:13,584
A patient?

122
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:16,030
Yes. Some folks in the Interior.

123
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:18,080
I should be back in about a week or so.

124
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:25,442
So, um, Eren's thinking about joining the Scouts.

125
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,331
Way to keep a secret, mouth!

126
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,477
Get that ridiculous thought out of
your head this instant, young man!

127
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:36,408
No son of mine is going to be fodder!

128
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:38,512
Do I make myself absolutely clear?

129
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:40,005
Stop yelling at me!

130
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,929
Don't you dare...

131
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,310
It's a nightmare, Eren.

132
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:46,219
The Outside. You really have no idea.

133
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:51,733
Yeah, I get it, okay? But it's
gotta be better than this life!

134
00:13:52,185 --> 00:13:55,285
I'm not stupid; I know it's ugly out there,

135
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:58,231
I know there's death around every corner. But...

136
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:00,810
We can't just give up on it.

137
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:04,524
'Cause otherwise this nightmare's never gonna end!

138
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,427
I see.

139
00:14:11,754 --> 00:14:14,218
Excuse me. I'll be late for the ferry.

140
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:17,442
Darling, wait! Scold the boy, for heaven's sake!

141
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:20,722
Scold him? Dear, please. Think this through.

142
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:25,315
Mere words won't hold back the boy's curiosity. Eren.

143
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:32,371
Behave while I'm gone and I'll let you in
on what I've been doing in the cellar. Agreed?

144
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:33,927
Yes sir, you got it!

145
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:39,355
Have a good trip!

146
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:43,225
I meant what I said.

147
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:43,961
What?

148
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,479
The whole idea is just irresponsible.

149
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:48,420
Huh? Irresponsible?

150
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:53,425
So, what? It's more grown up to settle for living in
fear behind some stupid wall your whole pointless life?

151
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:54,561
Eren!

152
00:14:58,018 --> 00:14:58,955
Mikasa.

153
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,647
The boy needs to be protected from himself.

154
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:04,922
Promise me whatever happens I
can count on you to have his back!

155
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:10,928
Where's the sacrilege now, huh?

156
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:15,167
Or does your philosophy say it's wrong to fight back, too?

157
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:20,135
As a matter of fact, it does. I'd rather
take a few lumps than brawl like a beast!

158
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,272
Oh, so now I'm a beast?

159
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:24,398
Take a good hard look at yourself
and tell me you're not acting like one!

160
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:27,659
You resort to violence because
your brain's the size of a walnut!

161
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:31,322
So pummel me all you want! I've already won!

162
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:35,084
Yeah, well you know what? I'm a sore loser!

163
00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:36,081
Back off!

164
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:39,353
It's Eren!

165
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,553
Hey, lookie here! Back for more?

166
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:43,190
You'd think he would have learned his lesson.

167
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:44,667
Give this one to me.

168
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,783
Oh crap. She's with him.

169
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:50,334
Run! Just run!

170
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:59,280
Heh-heh. That's all it takes.
One look. I'm just that scary.

171
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:01,582
Well, one of you is.

172
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:05,921
Where'd they get you, Armin?

173
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:11,647
It's alright. Thank you.

174
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:13,139
Okay.

175
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:21,299
Oh, they just heard me rattling on about
how mankind's future lay beyond the walls.

176
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:23,778
Doubt they understood half of it, but still.

177
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:24,833
Idiots.

178
00:16:26,645 --> 00:16:28,186
Why's it gotta be this way?

179
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:30,244
Why can't people just let us dream?

180
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,765
The walls are a powerful idea.

181
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,792
We've survived for a hundred years because
of them. No one's keen on tempting fate.

182
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:41,376
I may not agree with that sentiment,
but I can see where they're coming from.

183
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:43,442
It's human nature, Eren.

184
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:47,333
When all's said and done, the government's
policies are a reflection of our fear.

185
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:50,919
Yeah, the rest of the herd's
maybe. I say to hell with them!

186
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:52,595
Someone's gonna hear you.

187
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:55,049
Keep it down.

188
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:58,711
What do I care? You'll rat me out either way.

189
00:16:59,012 --> 00:16:59,568
What?

190
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:01,392
I never promised you anything.

191
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:03,429
Your folks know about the Scouts?

192
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,433
Basically. And they're not too pleased.

193
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:09,149
Yeah. Big shock.

194
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:14,923
It's sad.

195
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:20,684
What most people here are willing to settle for in
exchange for some fleeting sense of security, you know?

196
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:21,459
Momma!

197
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,425
And make no mistake, it absolutely is fleeting.

198
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,307
The walls can't hold forever.

199
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:33,938
Only a matter of time.

200
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,800
What was that?

201
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:55,500
I dunno!

202
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:59,243
I'm tellin' ya, it came from over there!

203
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:04,058
Armin, what are you doing?

204
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,834
Talk to me! What's going on? Some kinda explosion or...?

205
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:23,474
No! That's impossible!

206
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:26,173
That wall's fifty meters high!

207
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,909
Oh god.

208
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:35,641
It's a titan!

209
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:27,307
It... It blasted a hole. Like it was kicking a rock.

210
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:33,417
Run for your lives!

211
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:35,883
They've breeched the wall!

212
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,251
We have to go.

213
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:42,142
Eren! No!

214
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:45,809
Our house is in that direction! Mom's all by herself!

215
00:19:46,488 --> 00:19:47,571
Mikasa!

216
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:55,771
This... This is the end.

217
00:19:56,238 --> 00:20:02,698
They're inside. We... Every last
one of us is going to be devoured!

218
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:09,380
Our house is fine; our house is fine.

219
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:13,608
You'll turn the corner and it's gonna be
standing there in one piece, just like always!

220
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:20,147
Mom!

221
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:22,815
Mom!

222
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:25,779
Eren, wait!

223
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,751
Mikasa, grab that end and hoist with everything you got!

224
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,687
Oh, no.

225
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:49,373
Hurry up, dammit!

226
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,785
I'm trying!

227
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:54,155
It's them. You've got to get out of here!

228
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:57,994
Eren! Just take Mikasa and run! Now!

229
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,132
I want to, more than anything!

230
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:02,594
But first I need you on your feet!

231
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:06,155
Sweetie, listen to me. My legs have been crushed.

232
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:09,570
Even if you could get me out of here, I can't run.

233
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:11,380
There's no time.

234
00:21:11,475 --> 00:21:13,129
Whatever! I can carry you!

235
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,117
Will you just shut up and
listen to me for once in your life?

236
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:18,968
One thing I'm asking you! One thing!

237
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:20,714
Mikasa, make him!

238
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:23,540
I can't.

239
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:27,167
You want all three of us to die?

240
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,113
Hannes!

241
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:34,672
Take the children and get them out of here!

242
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:38,152
Come on, Carla; that's not our only option.

243
00:21:38,414 --> 00:21:40,092
Hey, I'm a trained soldier.

244
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:42,881
My skill set is killin' Titans and saving lives!

245
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:45,837
No, wait! Don't do this! Please!

246
00:21:46,312 --> 00:21:48,642
Nothing fancy. Just take it down.

247
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,685
Get all three of 'em out of harm's way.

248
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:53,249
Make good on the debt you owe!

249
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:13,256
No! What are you doing? Put me down, you bastard!

250
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:15,615
Thank you, Hannes.

251
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:17,559
Wait! No!

252
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:19,095
We can't just leave her!

253
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:21,573
I love you! You hear me?

254
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:23,964
Stay alive!

255
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:38,264
Don't leave me.

256
00:22:49,172 --> 00:22:53,292
Stop it! Nooooo!

257
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,428
And just like that. Everything changed.

258
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,007
At that terrible moment, in our hearts, we knew.

259
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:46,047
Home was a pen. Humanity, cattle.

260
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:31,334
Shiganshina crumbles. Prayers are useless.

261
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:35,071
Tears are absurd. Death agonies are nothing.

262
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:40,698
When total ruin is your reality, all
that's left of any value is revenge.
