1
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:06,665
I hate being right.

2
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:08,564
No time to lose! Move it!

3
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:10,414
She's coming for us!

4
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:16,873
After making a sudden reappearance,

5
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:21,753
the Female Titan wiped out the Levi
Squad's most elite soldiers, one by one.

6
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:28,297
I'm gonna...

7
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,654
Kill you!

8
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:31,500
Blaming himself for their deaths,

9
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:33,536
Eren turned back to face the enemy,

10
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:36,609
unleashing a furious assault in his Titan form.

11
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:42,068
Yet for all his rage, Eren was defeated,

12
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:44,252
and taken by the Female Titan.

13
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,770
Do you hear me? Give him back!

14
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,687
I know you're in there.

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,144
And after I kill her, I'll carve out her insides,

16
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:13,601
and pull you out again. I swear I will.

17
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:16,135
Just hang on a little longer.

18
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:18,081
Don't give up, Eren.

19
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:20,473
Never give up!

20
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,927
Get back here!

21
00:01:29,884 --> 00:01:30,945
What?

22
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:34,416
We'll stay back for now.

23
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,634
Maintain current distance.

24
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:23,696
She's slowed down a bit.

25
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:25,735
That fight wore her out, too.

26
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,380
It looked like she may have bitten the entire nape off.

27
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,494
It's unlikely Eren survived.

28
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:35,650
He's still alive in there.

29
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:38,565
This Titan is different; it acts with purpose.

30
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:41,369
If she wanted Eren dead, she could've simply crushed him.

31
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,554
No, she needs him for something.

32
00:03:44,714 --> 00:03:46,812
But she also needs her hands to fight,

33
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:49,045
so she's been holding him on her tongue.

34
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:52,431
It is possible she just wanted to savor her quarry.

35
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:55,283
In which case it's likely he's already been swallowed.

36
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:57,356
If so, he's dead.

37
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:58,866
He's alive.

38
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,909
Someone's optimistic.

39
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:07,270
If you had just done your damn
job and protected him like you

40
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:09,906
were supposed to, we wouldn't be having this conversation!

41
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:16,094
Oh, I see now. The "childhood friend", right?

42
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,264
Suddenly it's all making sense.

43
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,835
Right. For the sake of argument, let's narrow our goals.

44
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,107
First, we forget about taking her down.

45
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:29,256
No way. She's killed too many of our people for that.

46
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:30,351
She's dead.

47
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:33,617
She's got defenses that neither
of us has been trained to deal with.

48
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,452
I'm telling you it's a lost cause.

49
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,800
Instead, we'll act on your assumption that Eren is alive,

50
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,778
and focus only on freeing him before she exits the forest.

51
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,573
I'll handle all the cutting.

52
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:45,599
You find a way to distract her.

53
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,535
Right.

54
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:45,925
He's fast!

55
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:49,228
She can't even react! Her skin can't harden in time!

56
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:04,237
Her nape. It's wide open!

57
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:07,192
It looks like her whole body's gone limp.

58
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:09,392
Now's my chance!

59
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:13,683
Don't do it!

60
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:29,358
Eren!

61
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:37,261
Got him!

62
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:39,573
Time to go.

63
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:40,851
Eren.

64
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:46,367
He's alright. Disgusting, but alright.

65
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:50,308
What'd I tell you about trying
to take her down? Now come on.

66
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:54,209
We've got Eren. That means our work here is done.

67
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:57,094
Don't screw this up by making it personal, you understand?

68
00:06:57,991 --> 00:07:00,590
We all get that you love him, but try not to act crazy.

69
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,102
I... I was just...

70
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,834
They're already on the way back?

71
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:28,107
Is that bad?

72
00:07:28,537 --> 00:07:29,492
Probably. Odds are they'll have

73
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:32,287
a stack of fresh corpses in tow.

74
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,267
It sounds like Eld will be home sooner than we thought.

75
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:57,632
Is that so?

76
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,329
Think they'll give Oruo enough
time to pop by and say hello?

77
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:07,353
I suppose in any event we can
set a place for him at the table.

78
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:13,810
They say Gunther's coming back.

79
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,215
Do they?

80
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:23,133
This is the part of our job I'll never get used to.

81
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,200
You're not alone in that.

82
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:29,776
Seems like death's just everywhere.

83
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:32,571
All I can think about is how it'll end.

84
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:35,861
Which one of us is next and whether it'll be me.

85
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,468
Try not to obsess over it.

86
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:44,401
Only thing that train of thought's good
for is breaking your nerve. Believe me.

87
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,546
Push it out of your mind.

88
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,342
I s'pose you're right.

89
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:52,193
Nah, I know you're right.

90
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:59,830
So how much longer 'til our number's up, you think?

91
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:03,413
I dunno, but we've made it this far.

92
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,194
Yeah, luck of the draw.

93
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:09,976
So what? We're alive. Be glad for it.

94
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:14,670
Sorry, it's kinda hard to celebrate around so many bodies.

95
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:25,587
They'll never see home again. Why should we?

96
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:30,823
Almost done, sir.

97
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,531
We estimate about five to be unrecoverable.

98
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,432
Not even an arm or a leg?

99
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,293
Sadly, the Titans didn't leave much behind.

100
00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:45,361
And honestly sir, I think it would be best for the
families if we didn't bring back what little there is.

101
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:47,983
We'll put them down as "missing".

102
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:48,721
Sir.

103
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,776
Also, sir. Our spotters report several
Titans have emerged from the forest.

104
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:56,635
Fortunately, none yet seem to be headed in our direction.

105
00:10:56,802 --> 00:11:00,123
We move out immediately. Inform the squads.

106
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:00,996
Sir.

107
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,117
No! I refuse! It's inhumane!

108
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,349
Damn you, shut up!

109
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:10,679
We can't just leave 'em out here! He was
there! I saw Ivan's body. He was right in front us!

110
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,176
And if you didn't notice, there were Titans nearby.

111
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:15,425
Go back and we could wind up dead ourselves.

112
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,307
So if they attack, we'll fight! It's what we do, right?

113
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:21,231
Ivan and me, we grew up in the same town together.

114
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:23,353
His parents are like family to me!

115
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:25,633
I can't face them again if we leave him!

116
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,125
Sentimental garbage!

117
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:28,428
Stop shrieking.

118
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:30,795
Captain Levi!

119
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:34,546
If you've already confirmed his
death, then there's nothing more to do.

120
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:38,169
Whether we have his body or not makes no difference now.

121
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,443
He's still just as dead either way.

122
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:42,373
That's cold.

123
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:45,368
Ivan and the others will be listed as missing in action.

124
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:48,261
That's my decision and it's final. Now let it go.

125
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:53,185
You heartless bastards!

126
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,489
That's the kind of respect you show
the men who give their lives for you?

127
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:59,796
Unless you want to be MIA, I suggest you shut your mouth!

128
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,284
Wait!

129
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,445
Heads up! We've got company!

130
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:46,121
Titans!

131
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:54,397
Is that...?

132
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,354
Dieter!

133
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:02,650
That damn fool.

134
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:07,622
Enemy spotted at the rear!

135
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,450
Full speed! All soldiers!

136
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:13,938
Our best chance might be to circle
back, make a beeline for the trees.

137
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,367
We can't put up much of a fight out here.

138
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:18,994
No, our best option now is to continue to the wall.

139
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,489
It's about to be right on top of us!

140
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:49,641
Looks like we've got no choice but to fight!

141
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:54,045
Ground's too flat to engage ODM gear. And not only that...

142
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,990
We'll soon be outnumbered.

143
00:13:56,965 --> 00:14:00,031
Perfect. Then what do you suggest we do, genius?

144
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,601
The only thing we can.

145
00:14:38,915 --> 00:14:40,945
We're done! It's gaining on us!

146
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,344
I'll jump behind the bastard and distract him!

147
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,551
Give you a chance to put some distance...

148
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:45,427
Don't bother.

149
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,810
You've got to jettison the extra weight.

150
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:49,073
Dump the bodies.

151
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:50,971
B-B-But, sir!

152
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:54,180
Do you know how many corpses we've already left behind?

153
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,175
These aren't special. Dump them!

154
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:58,391
Consider it their last service to the cause.

155
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:03,117
Are we doing this? We can't seriously be doing this!

156
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:08,274
Damn it.

157
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:12,929
I'm sorry, there's just no other way!

158
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:44,445
That's it! We're losing him!

159
00:15:57,186 --> 00:16:01,129
Alright, soldiers, look sharp. We head
out the moment our positions are confirmed.

160
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:04,773
A minor course correction to the East should work.

161
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:17,004
Captain, I... I wanted to say.

162
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,890
We can't always carry our fallen comrades home,

163
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:25,346
but we carry their memory.

164
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,739
This was Ivan's.

165
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,677
Thank you, sir.

166
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:57,442
Let's move 'em out!

167
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:20,533
Eren. You should let the Scout Regiment thing go.

168
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:24,321
Seriously? Why does everybody think they're a joke?

169
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:27,259
What people think about 'em isn't really the issue.

170
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:36,202
Perfect timing! They're back!

171
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:40,666
We can make it if we hurry.
Get a move on! I want a good view!

172
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,313
Sure taken a hit, haven't they?

173
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,817
Yeah. Rest of 'em got eaten.

174
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:08,854
That's what happens when pride
takes you outside the walls.

175
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:14,088
Nothing like seeing our hard earned taxes go
toward keeping those bastards fat and happy, right?

176
00:18:14,904 --> 00:18:15,432
Eren.

177
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:21,851
What is it?

178
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:31,311
Talk to me.

179
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:38,422
Eren!

180
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,177
Easy.

181
00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:56,645
Don't try to move just yet.

182
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:58,679
You need rest.

183
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:01,214
Where's the Female Titan?

184
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:03,940
She got away from us.

185
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:08,531
What do you mean? She... She was... We were...

186
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,107
What about the mission?

187
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,603
It didn't go as planned.

188
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,580
But don't worry about that right now.

189
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:19,481
How'd I get here?

190
00:19:20,515 --> 00:19:23,762
Did you have to step in and save me again? Is that it?

191
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:30,475
Look. We're almost home, okay?

192
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:52,125
Am I miscounting, or are there
fewer of 'em than when they left?

193
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:54,302
No, there's a lot fewer.

194
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:56,345
Must've been a bad one.

195
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:01,973
I don't get it. They were all piss and
vinegar this morning. They're already back?

196
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,656
Hell, why bother leavin' in the first place?

197
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:08,972
No idea. I'd say by the looks on
their faces they hoped to be gone longer.

198
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:14,476
Our taxes hard at work, ladies and gentlemen. Bravo.

199
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:19,853
Eren. Ignore it.

200
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:34,712
Awesome! Beat, but they're still ready to go!

201
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:37,270
You gotta be made of nails to ride with these guys!

202
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:38,692
They're unstoppable!

203
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:00,087
Excuse me, Captain Levi?

204
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,306
G-Good evening. I, uh... Yes.

205
00:21:02,455 --> 00:21:04,283
I'm Petra's father, sir.

206
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:07,119
Might I bend your ear before she sees us?

207
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,503
I received this letter from her somewhat recently.

208
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,569
Apparently you handpicked her yourself?

209
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:14,507
She's very excited, I can assure you.

210
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,020
In fact, it sounds like she's
utterly devoted to you in every way.

211
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:22,692
So devoted that, well, to be honest her
mother and I are a bit concerned, you see.

212
00:21:24,644 --> 00:21:28,141
Now, I... I know that fathers can have trouble letting go.

213
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:32,447
But still, I can't help but feel she's
far too young to be thinking about marriage.

214
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:35,673
She has so much yet to experience before settling down.

215
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:39,392
Give us some answers, damn you! We have a right!

216
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,561
How many lives were lost on this mission?

217
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:43,516
Was it worth it? Was is really worth it?

218
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:46,955
You think the last thing going through
their minds was "for the good of humanity?"

219
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:53,477
The causalities incurred during the Scout Regiment's
latest excursion beyond the wall were profound.

220
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:58,878
So much so, that what little public
favor they still held was all but crushed.

221
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:11,910
Within hours of their return,

222
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:15,485
Erwin and the battle-weary
survivors were called to the capital.

223
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:19,854
The Scouts' custody of Eren was summarily revoked.

224
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:59,000
Having been assigned to the elite security
escort team the day Eren is summoned to the capital,

225
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:02,373
Annie faces a dilemma when Armin emerges from the shadows,

226
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:06,507
imploring her help in a secret
mission of vital importance.
