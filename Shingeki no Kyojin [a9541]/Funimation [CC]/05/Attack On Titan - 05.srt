1
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:48,533
You.

2
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:41,233
Sir!

3
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,251
Sir!

4
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:01,916
Hey!

5
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,943
Fire!

6
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:20,509
Shit.

7
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:52,032
What?

8
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:59,371
Yeah!

9
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:25,042
Eren!

10
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:50,554
Eren!

11
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:56,287
Eren!

12
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:28,967
Eren!

13
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:50,571
Franz.

14
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:33,838
Armin!

15
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:37,490
Pyxis!

16
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:33,882
Quiet!

17
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:26,548
Damn it!

18
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:26,301
Move it!

19
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,594
Um, okay.

20
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:20,679
Why? Why?

21
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,094
Eren! No!

22
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:29,957
Take this!

23
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:47,212
Ahhhhhhhh!

24
00:19:48,495 --> 00:19:51,251
No. Armin.

25
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,770
Look alive!

26
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:52,002
Oh god, no!

27
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,173
Eren! Eren!

28
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:03,202
Look at me.

29
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,574
What the...?

30
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:38,035
No, I'm not.

31
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:43,064
Strike here.

32
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:23,423
You bastard!

33
00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,590
Is this real?

34
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:29,798
Is that true?

35
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:52,645
Son of a bitch.

36
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,812
How did I miss?

37
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,477
I'm sorry, I...

38
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:37,428
Lord Wald, Sir.

39
00:15:32,026 --> 00:15:33,125
Excuse me, sir.

40
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,318
this is insane!

41
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:35,686
Yeah, whatever.

42
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:37,931
'Course you are!

43
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:33,142
Soldiers, charge!

44
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:48,323
Let's get moving.

45
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:57,899
Let that sink in.

46
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:52,028
It's been a while.

47
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:18,414
The Titans are in.

48
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:29,733
Please be a dream.

49
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:44,033
Jean! Get ahold...

50
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:28,573
We have to act now!

51
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:40,514
Tell me. Seriously.

52
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:11,453
If they get through,

53
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:56,038
Armin? What's wrong?

54
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,090
What's one more day?

55
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:45,259
Is that a challenge?

56
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:21,805
Prepare to intercept!

57
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:48,743
Sorry, I... I'm okay.

58
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:09,432
You gonna be alright?

59
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:56,800
Right! Give 'em hell!

60
00:19:58,267 --> 00:19:59,718
Why are you shouting?

61
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,904
We're trained for this!

62
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:03,661
They die and stay dead.

63
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:23,818
They call it "The Sea!"

64
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:54,743
He took out the cannons!

65
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:23,134
One would think so, yes.

66
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:01,343
Sir. With all due re...!

67
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:18,005
You're right; I'm sorry.

68
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:22,647
There's so many of them!

69
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:16,926
I've gotta take him down!

70
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:05,926
led by the support squad.

71
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:35,417
but we're gonna finish it!

72
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,844
Mounted Cannon Squad Four,

73
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,312
Unless we seal the breach,

74
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,820
Preparations must be made!

75
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:44,565
Ackermann, you're with me.

76
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:14,199
It's a golden opportunity.

77
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:26,986
Wait! Stay with the group!

78
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:50,735
It does sound really neat.

79
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,809
The scent so like flowers.

80
00:05:56,652 --> 00:05:58,777
I... Don't worry, I'm fine.

81
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:12,832
Have some damn perspective!

82
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:12,112
Look at it this way, Armin.

83
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,627
Oh my god. Please. Help me.

84
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:40,574
take out the Colossal Titan!

85
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:30,449
What kinda question is that?

86
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,593
Damn it! Shut up for second!

87
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:47,773
I beg your pardon, young man.

88
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,426
One man of action to another.

89
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:50,551
Better not fudge your scores.

90
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,065
The gate was no accident then.

91
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:07,604
Come now. Take this seriously.

92
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,078
Pyxis, please! I'm beggin you!

93
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,354
Why'd this have to happen now?

94
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:50,828
I have to see them. I have to!

95
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:56,611
All of a sudden, it's raining.

96
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:46,027
No! Not all of us are suicidal!

97
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,759
You can do this, Jean. Alright?

98
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,153
I hadn't planned on it. Thanks.

99
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:51,926
That, as you may have surmised,

100
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:38,431
We've got an Abnormal! Hold up!

101
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:46,348
The things you told me about...

102
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:23,818
As the Titan onslaught advanced,

103
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:33,273
Mankind didn't start this fight,

104
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:24,753
On your feet, Daz. Stop bawling.

105
00:04:00,218 --> 00:04:02,434
Did he just vanish into thin air?

106
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:10,170
You understand what we're facing.

107
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,744
I promise we'll get through this.

108
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:17,575
Where are you going? Pyxis, wait!

109
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:08,483
Rear guard will go to the elites.

110
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:31,749
We're all about to be Titan chow.

111
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:57,051
The mass exodus is falling apart.

112
00:23:57,051 --> 00:24:00,079
The sound is so faint. So gentle.

113
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,650
Time to put your training to work!

114
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:18,729
the entire city's as good as dead!

115
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,151
I expect you all to man your posts

116
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:42,193
Your mission is a very simple one:

117
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,051
Who the hell do you think you are?

118
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,026
They're simply in it for the kill.

119
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,954
No head-starts for you this round!

120
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:04,502
File through as calmly as possible!

121
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,896
Commander Pyxis, sir! I bring news!

122
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,105
I obsequiously accept it as a gift.

123
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:18,879
Please, no. Please, no. Please, no.

124
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:30,943
Five years later, in the year 850...

125
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,468
If they start pouring in, that's it!

126
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:28,588
Seriously, how long? Think about it.

127
00:07:18,993 --> 00:07:21,419
in your approach to the game, Pyxis.

128
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:58,476
Not everyone can say that, can they?

129
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:33,318
I want you to come find me, alright?

130
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,776
giant rocks that take days to climb.

131
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:07,246
Your lordship, if I may speak freely.

132
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,290
Please don't go. Don't do this to me!

133
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:26,022
Just promise... Promise me one thing.

134
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,939
we'll have a repeat of five years ago.

135
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:49,468
You're safe as long as I'm beside you.

136
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,051
Why not remain where I can assist you?

137
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,683
That's enough, soldier. Good day, Sir.

138
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:40,038
The whole area is well-nigh saturated.

139
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,609
Come and find me so I can protect you.

140
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,125
We're on the verge of extinction here.

141
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:09,557
we do know something of their ecology.

142
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:19,843
we'll rise up right through the ranks.

143
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:34,364
Sounds good. I'm with you all the way.

144
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:01,883
They'll know what it's like firsthand.

145
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:34,296
I refuse to die like this, understand?

146
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:10,849
He's gone! Exactly like five years ago.

147
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:16,768
Consider this the last line of defense!

148
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:41,352
We're not gonna be the victims anymore!

149
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:12,561
Very well. Yet another victory is mine.

150
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,198
How can you hope to thwart the Titan...

151
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,318
Cadets will be taking the middle guard,

152
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:37,315
Right! Those in the vanguard, be ready!

153
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:44,376
No. I won't allow myself to get killed.

154
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:24,847
We can bypass rookie status altogether!

155
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:36,037
What's wrong with me? Why can't I move?

156
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:37,718
I expect you to take part! Report to HQ!

157
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,328
The Titans get held off here or nowhere!

158
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:54,129
Reports say the gate has been destroyed!

159
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,954
That's right; the outer gate is history.

160
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,900
Almost everything about them is obscure.

161
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:10,950
Don't! Please stop! I don't want to die!

162
00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:03,825
He... He planned it. He has intelligence!

163
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:45,081
Commander, I'll go ready the horses, Sir.

164
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:11,093
Stuff about the outside world is illegal.

165
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,259
Seriously. You could go to jail for that.

166
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:21,662
Twenty percent of the human race perished.

167
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:29,151
What the hell, man? What's wrong with you?

168
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:31,509
Eren. If things take a turn for the worse,

169
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:00,884
Titans aren't motivated by hunger as such.

170
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:50,370
This is the chink in the proverbial armor.

171
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:39,513
Save some of the glory for the rest of us!

172
00:20:06,146 --> 00:20:08,529
I really hope this is your idea of a joke.

173
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:42,151
Water that glows like fire; fields of ice;

174
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:43,759
This is our chance! Don't let it slip away!

175
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:14,090
Without him, the other Titans have nothing!

176
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:44,790
Defend the wall 'til the evacuation's done!

177
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:36,284
What? We're in completely different squads!

178
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:31,968
As if their size wasn't frightening enough.

179
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:40,960
There is, in fact, one way to ensure death.

180
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,438
The vanguard's been completely overwhelmed!

181
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:31,693
merchants would've scooped it out ages ago!

182
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:47,739
Imagine how huge the outside world must be!

183
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:13,825
knowing the Advance Team has been wiped out.

184
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:43,234
I was one day shy of shipping off to the MP!

185
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:04,426
Hell, some people actually died, but not us!

186
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:31,122
Whatever happens. Don't get yourself killed.

187
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,384
Thanks to the efforts of the Scout Regiment,

188
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:32,760
I thought things would be hairy, but this...

189
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:11,102
All the more reason not to waste this moment!

190
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:02,064
Pare down! Take only what you need to survive!

191
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:01,027
Just give me a second for my nerves to settle.

192
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,718
Ah. This vintage is worthy of your good taste.

193
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,188
You expect me to sing you a happy little song?

194
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:40,371
You're whole life's aspiration is to be eaten!

195
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:14,288
The MP will still be waiting for you tomorrow.

196
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:19,409
But that alone proved tragically insufficient.

197
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,419
and the monster is left no time to regenerate.

198
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:34,443
Operation Colossal Titan Response is in effect.

199
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,736
Damn it all, it's your sworn duty to defend us!

200
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:07,718
Am I right? We powered through for three years!

201
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:51,276
But, sir! I'm a cadet! I'll slow everyone down!

202
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:25,176
Though there is some variability on this score,

203
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,801
Out of the frying pan and into the fire, cadets!

204
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,572
You can't just march off! I command you to stay!

205
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:20,603
This whole situation just has me out of my head.

206
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:38,643
Just bear with me; there's a lot more than salt.

207
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:44,013
Sir! We pray the Advance Team will be victorious!

208
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:25,616
How long do you think before they take Wall Rose?

209
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:26,410
Clearly my brain is inferior to yours, Lord Wald.

210
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:54,741
All squadrons are responsible for supply-running,

211
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:39,439
You're not getting away! You're not getting away!

212
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:26,734
Like, salty for real? C'mon, you're making it up.

213
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:54,176
If it comes to it, lay down your lives! Dismissed!

214
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:36,311
You're loving this, aren't you, you little psycho?

215
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:52,049
What do you think the last three years were about?

216
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:54,739
You're not being asked for a self-evaluation here.

217
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,559
This is bigger than the two of us and you know it!

218
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,044
Squadron 34, move out! The vanguard needs support!

219
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:06,013
Believe it or not, it's about life on the outside!

220
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:27,226
our only choice was to withdrawal behind Wall Rose.

221
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:01,699
The Intercept Squadron will be taking the vanguard.

222
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:02,785
Sorry. I found a book my grandpa keeps hidden away!

223
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,801
Odd how it can remind you of something so horrible.

224
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:40,585
If you got close to the damn thing, we need details!

225
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:14,034
but we couldn't figure out how to hoist it in place.

226
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:35,797
We also know their body temperatures run quite high.

227
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,348
I mean if we prove our worth as soldiers right here,

228
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:28,973
I don't believe this. Those guys always talk so big!

229
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:39,040
Listen to me. You're focused on the past. Look ahead.

230
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:10,270
Should the commander actually face a Titan in battle,

231
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:22,109
This means the "Armored Titan" is likely to reappear.

232
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:04,743
Now, that isn't to suggest we're completely ignorant.

233
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,195
We survived. We stared death in the face and we lived.

234
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,742
a Titan's head usually regenerates within two minutes.

235
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,652
Are you basically saying that the Titans are immortal?

236
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:55,182
is where the flesh-paring blades you see here come in.

237
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:22,443
Before long we could even be leading our own regiment.

238
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,593
Now, now boys. You're not the only ones in your class.

239
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:42,007
Good luck beatin' us to the punch a second time, Eren.

240
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:35,211
Get back here! You're gonna pay for killing my friend!

241
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:42,741
Armin, listen. We're still going to the outside world.

242
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:15,195
He's here one moment and gone the next; just like that.

243
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:11,339
That huge boulder near the front gate was our best bet,

244
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:51,134
The Colossal Titan has laid siege to the city of Trost!

245
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:22,359
you can't reach the bottom! There's a name for it, too!

246
00:04:19,502 --> 00:04:22,416
Don't apologize. Look at us. We were too scared to move.

247
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,339
Yes, well, no help for it, is there? If it's their time.

248
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:52,072
I want everyone split into four squadrons, as practiced.

249
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:06,746
You've been given a direct order! Pull it together. Now!

250
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:22,680
Even with their heads blown to bits, the Titans persist.

251
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:25,103
My friends are being devoured and all I can do is watch.

252
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:34,652
That's the thing! The Sea never runs out! It's that big!

253
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:26,167
If and when he does, the inner gate will also be history.

254
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:47,359
You've been assigned to the rear guard on special orders.

255
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:07,109
Eren! Where'd he go? Did he
get away or'd you take him out?

256
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:43,710
I have faith each of you will
be a credit to your regiment!

257
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,735
An astronomical number of
lives snuffed out in a twinkling.

258
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:32,771
God, what if the bastards
manage to bust through Wall Rose?

259
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:54,420
Okay, you've got to promise
on your life not to tell anyone.

260
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:07,300
In the year 845, two terrifying
new breeds of Titan appeared:

261
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:05,666
Just one more day and I'd have
been heading for the Interior!

262
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:58,631
A good, deep strike with one
of these to a Titan's weak spot,

263
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:16,437
Mankind has long possessed
cannon technology, as you're aware.

264
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:48,551
Listen up. Whoever kills the
most Titans gets bragging rights.

265
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,462
Some people couldn't take it
and either ran or were thrown out.

266
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:45,928
In fact, a Titan's driving
principle seems to be this appetite.

267
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:12,382
We have only to consider events
of the recent past to see this.

268
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:27,895
As they lack reproductive organs,
it's unclear how they reproduce.

269
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:13,717
he won't feel compelled to play
down his skill as he does with you.

270
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:55,888
we surmise that these creatures
do not in fact, consume us to live.

271
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:18,738
The territory couched within the
circle of Wall Maria was abandoned.

272
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:24,951
I wish you another opulently
appointed day of sloth and tranquility.

273
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:50,175
Now. Be aware, all of you, that
desertion is punishable by execution!

274
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,568
If something valuable like salt
was just floating around under water,

275
00:12:57,134 --> 00:13:00,151
We need as many elite soldiers as
possible to get things back on track.

276
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,424
Not until I taste what life is like
outside of these godforsaken walls.

277
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:08,718
The terrifying vitality of these
creatures is beyond scientific dispute.

278
00:20:13,284 --> 00:20:15,926
Trust me, you'd change your mind if
you knew what was actually out there!

279
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,208
Hey! Wallow on your own time! In case
you hadn't noticed, there's a breach.

280
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:39,818
Look. This is gonna get ugly and when
it does the plan goes out the window.

281
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:14,301
Whether Titans possess human-like
intelligence is up for debate, of course.

282
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:30,279
Assemble your troops and establish a
garrison around my estate this instant!

283
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,681
message relay, and enemy combat under
the command of the Garrision Regiment!

284
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,102
If the back of their neck takes adequate
damage, a Titan will not regenerate.

285
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:18,512
And to date there've been no reports
of high-level communication between them.

286
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:32,814
Any time the mood strikes them, they can
wipe out the human race in an afternoon!

287
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:49,920
When the dust has settled, there may
well be more graves than people to dig them.

288
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:24,297
We do know that Titan physiology is
fundamentally different than most organic life.

289
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:32,310
Apart from this, to all appearances, their
physique resembles the average human male.

290
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:35,125
Such obsequiousness from the single
highest-ranking officer in the southern territory.

291
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:18,968
Dear oh dear. One would think our monthly
rows would see at least some modest improvement

292
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:41,579
And, baffling though it is, their appetite
seems geared exclusively towards human beings.

293
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:19,801
For example, according to this book, most of
the world is covered with salty water so deep

294
00:21:04,134 --> 00:21:08,618
We should do it ourselves one day. We can
have adventures like the guy who wrote this book.

295
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:59,084
What surviving historical documents we have
access to tell us nothing of the Titans' origin.

296
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:59,149
But my parents are, uh... Well, they're going
to sneak outside the walls to see for themselves.

297
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:42,593
Untold numbers of our brave comrades-in-arms are
laying down their lives in defense of Trost as we speak.

298
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:03,187
Besides, what earthly good can the presence of a man
who persistently loses to me at chess do for them now?

299
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:51,860
Given that they've subsisted for over a century without
access to their only source of nourishment, however,

300
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:13,583
the Colossal and the Armored, barreling through the
outer walls as if wholesale destruction was child's play.

301
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:04,904
This is bad, isn't it? There's a
hole in the wall eight meters wide

302
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,916
and we don't even remotely have
the engineering know-how to plug it.
