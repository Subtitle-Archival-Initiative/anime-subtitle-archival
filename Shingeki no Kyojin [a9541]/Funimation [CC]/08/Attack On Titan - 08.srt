197
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:05,825
In the year 850, the Colossal Titan again appeared

211
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,715
and decimated yet another barrier between us and them.

251
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:14,592
Once more, mankind retreated in panic
before the advance of its greatest foe.

137
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,986
Brave soul after brave soul perished.

29
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,401
Eaten alive.

19
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,681
Eren! No!

155
00:00:29,673 --> 00:00:32,366
Eren, himself, fell prey to their hunger.

66
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,709
Whoa, Mikasa is a badass!

67
00:00:36,498 --> 00:00:37,975
How is she going so fast?

107
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:41,360
No! Mikasa's using too much gas!

115
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:43,362
I'll do whatever it takes to win!

74
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:45,133
Whatever it takes to live!

191
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:49,251
Just when things seemed their darkest for Mikasa,

179
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:52,673
out of nowhere came the unlikeliest of allies.

156
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:42,488
There. Got it! The ODM gear's functional.

93
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,252
And I restocked your blades.

138
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,677
Just... Just leave me this one, okay?

246
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:52,404
It's just that... I would rather
this be my end, not being eaten alive.

34
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:00,155
Why'd you...?

9
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,221
Armin.

94
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,109
I will not leave you behind.

147
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:14,188
But... I mean... Titans are everywhere!

180
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:16,261
You can't jump and carry me on your back at...

55
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,541
Come on. Let's move.

181
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:24,514
Please. Don't do this. It's not going to work.

143
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:28,033
Enough people have died on my account.

1
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:40,080
No!

75
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:43,316
Hold on! I've got an idea!

44
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:44,697
What is it then?

248
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:50,823
Only you two are capable of pulling
this off, so it's really your choice.

208
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:55,765
This may sound crazy, but I think he might be useful.

68
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:57,546
Whoa, you mean the Titan?

97
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:59,454
He only attacks his own kind.

124
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,681
He seems to have no interest in us.

252
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,155
What if we can somehow steer him to HQ
and let him loose on the other Titans?

198
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:08,992
Look, we know he's taken at least one out already.

84
00:04:09,278 --> 00:04:11,161
We can use him as a weapon!

85
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:13,196
You have got to be kidding!

220
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:15,531
How the hell you think we're supposed to steer that thing!

201
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,447
Well, something tells me he's fighting on instinct.

261
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,682
I'm almost sure if you take down the pair
he's tangling with now, he'll go look for others.

105
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,717
That'd lead him straight to HQ.

173
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:27,053
We're not steering him so much as luring him.

108
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:29,072
I think it'll work. I really do.

238
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:32,479
Think? You're asking us to risk
our necks on a stupid gut feeling?

259
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:36,800
If I'm right about this, we can put down
the siege on headquarters in one fell swoop!

49
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:40,876
It's worth a shot.

41
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,814
Huh? Seriously?

257
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,873
Better to take a gamble on Armin's gut
feeling than wait around to be slaughtered.

159
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,485
If there's a decent shot, why not take it?

174
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:52,181
So, basically we're going to recruit a Titan?

35
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,262
Yes. Exactly.

162
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:00,403
We'll look like morons if we screw this up.

225
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:05,084
Yeah. But if we don't, look
how many lives we stand to save.

125
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,736
Where there's a will there's a way.

126
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:11,176
It's still nuts, but what the hell.

69
00:05:16,898 --> 00:05:18,785
Why couldn't I stop them?

216
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:24,262
I'm the last person that should've been given the reigns!

86
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:35,066
No! No. This is our chance.

242
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:39,386
We can get the drop on them while
they're preoccupied. It's perfect!

20
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,938
Let's go!

192
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:46,566
Make for a break for HQ while they're distracted!

221
00:05:58,026 --> 00:06:02,371
We can do this! Hey, we run out of gas, we're dead anyway.

102
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,610
Give it everything you've got!

5
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:52,525
Jean!

231
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:56,293
You really came through for us
there, man; we owe you big time.

2
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:57,007
Huh?

226
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,434
Don't shrug it off, I'm serious.
We're alive because of you!

139
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,715
Like I said, you make a great leader!

182
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:05,910
Easy with that crap. We're not outta this yet!

16
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:16,384
Damn it!

127
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,735
How many... How many of us made it?

116
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:42,193
How many bodies did I crawl over?

163
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:45,687
How many of our comrades died on my orders?

175
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,235
Hold on a sec. You guys with the supply team?

6
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:00,556
Yeah.

26
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:05,647
Jean! Stop!

183
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:08,324
You cowards! You left us out there on our own!

232
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:11,716
People are dead 'cause you
didn't have the guts to do your job!

184
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,989
The Titans were coming at us from every angle!

128
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:16,276
They overran the supply room, okay?

204
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:19,311
It's your job to deal with it and back us up anyway!

36
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:23,385
Hit the deck!

27
00:08:29,381 --> 00:08:30,365
Son of a...

164
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:33,777
There's too many people! They can smell us!

3
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:34,735
Run!

42
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:36,328
Get further in!

61
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,646
We can't all go at once!

120
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:39,148
Where's Mikasa? Have you seen her?

193
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:42,272
She ran out of gas. Forget about her. She's dead!

95
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:47,031
This is it. This is reality.

129
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,264
Of course it is. How deluded was I?

165
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,690
No. No, on some level, I knew it all along.

217
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:01,228
I mean, when you stop and think for second, it's obvious.

140
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:05,956
There's no winning. Not against them.

7
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:16,981
What?

87
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:32,354
Wha... What the...? My god.

50
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:37,044
Mikasa, you're...!

148
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,998
Wow. Close one. I was running on fumes.

166
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,889
We made it here, though! Crazy, but we did!

152
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,548
You... I... Am I dreaming this, or what?

76
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:48,068
You're a certified genius!

205
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:50,705
From now on, far as I'm concerned, your word is law!

253
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:55,170
Check it out! We found an Abnormal
that's got a bone to pick with its own kind.

199
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,349
And the best part? He couldn't care less about us!

254
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:03,243
That's right, you heard me. This big
beautiful S.O.B.'s our ticket out of here!

144
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,781
You mean like fighting fire with fire?

187
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,410
Listen to yourself. A Titan's not gonna help us!

209
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:10,053
You're out of your mind if you think this can work...

39
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:11,316
It is working.

188
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:14,320
For whatever reason he's rampaging against them.

202
00:10:14,723 --> 00:10:17,831
Stand back and let him do it. Trust me. You'll see.

130
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:26,027
Either way. What choice do we have?

206
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:29,427
Right now that thing is our best chance at survival.

243
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:55,671
Look at him go! This guy makes
the others look like total weaklings.

141
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,557
They're not gonna take this building.

132
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:04,428
Not with him on a rampage out there.

70
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,328
That's all well and good.

218
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,196
But what's to keep him from turning on us once he's done?

176
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:14,493
Guess we'll worry about that when we're safe.

222
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:18,222
Yeah, you're right. At least he's buying us a little time.

24
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:19,331
Good news!

109
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:22,512
Courtesy of the Military Police.

117
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:25,227
And covered with a layer of dust.

200
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:29,549
Are you absolutely sure buckshot is the way to go?

168
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,592
Seems like we might as well throw spit wads.

169
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:36,899
I mean, c'mon guys. Are guns even effective?

210
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:40,998
I dunno, but they're bound to be better than nothing.

256
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:45,748
We're looking at seven Titans in the
supply room of the four-meters-tall variety.

77
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,616
If we time this perfectly,

189
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,556
this much ammo oughta be enough to do the trick.

255
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:55,760
Step one, we lower a group into the
area via lift to get the Titans' attention.

264
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:58,475
Step two, when the Titans
come within range, the group

265
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,583
fires in all four directions
simultaneously, blinding them.

53
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:03,392
Then the hard part.

110
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:05,402
The moment of truth, as it were.

149
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,486
Before the Titans have time to recover,

247
00:12:09,537 --> 00:12:13,175
seven of us swoop down from the
ceiling and strike their vital regions.

88
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:15,739
That's it. That's the plan.

133
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,136
It puts all our lives on the line...

62
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:18,543
We screw up, we're dead.

236
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,325
That's a hell of a risk for one
attack, but it's our only chance.

244
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:27,846
Seven people have to slay seven
Titans in one blow, at the same time.

263
00:12:29,737 --> 00:12:35,038
We're gonna need the best of you. The seven soldiers
most physically gifted and adept with their paring blades.

240
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:38,279
You'll be the difference between
life and death for the rest of us.

96
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:41,116
I'm sorry. That's how it is.

63
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,672
Seems like a sound plan.

237
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:45,588
When you get right down to it,
the risk is the same for everyone.

106
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:47,452
Doesn't really matter who goes.

190
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:50,158
Look, I... I'm willing to be talked out of this.

213
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:53,470
One half-baked strategy can't be our only option, right?

121
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:55,376
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.

122
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,925
C'mon, with what we're looking at?

219
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,429
'Cause for our only option, it's pretty well thought-out.

203
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:01,899
If we give it our all, we might just pull this off!

177
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,070
It'll be fine. You just have to be confident.

229
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:08,405
You're a better strategist
than you give yourself credit for.

30
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,383
I'm serious.

178
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:13,220
That mind's saved Eren and me more than once.

150
00:13:13,537 --> 00:13:16,231
When did I ever save you? That's not...

233
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,293
Alright, the lift's ready to
go. Guns are loaded to the stocks.

78
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:22,850
Let's go kill some Titans!

123
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,820
You didn't realize it at the time.

89
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,455
We can talk about it later.

157
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:32,129
Okay. I'm gonna ask the obvious question.

111
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:34,496
Can we do this without ODM gear?

194
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,414
No problem. These guys are only four-meters tall.

195
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,606
Their weak spots are not too far above eye level.

262
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:45,889
He's right. Size won't be an issue; the spot's
still only one meter high and ten centimeters across.

158
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,485
Back 'o the head to the nape o' the neck!

249
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:52,197
Worse comes to worst, you can always
just shove one of these up their ass.

90
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:53,873
That's the other weak spot.

45
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:55,269
Are you serious?

51
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,671
That's news to me!

160
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,885
Did I miss a day of training or something?

103
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,881
Come on. Knock it off, Reiner.

170
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:03,908
You want your final words to be an ass joke?

91
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:20,781
Good. We're still at seven.

64
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,263
Okay now, nice and easy.

57
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,941
Don't lose your cool!

153
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:41,134
Fire only when they're all within range!

10
00:14:45,774 --> 00:14:46,807
Steady.

79
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:52,243
That's right; wait for it.

98
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:54,681
Our lives are riding on this.

99
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,231
Gotta make this attack count.

21
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:00,386
Steady...

22
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,197
Almost...

8
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,228
Fire!

11
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:26,943
Got it!

46
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:28,573
How're you guys?

131
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:42,472
Uh... I, uh... I'm sorry. I didn't.

17
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:43,503
Oh crap.

118
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:45,385
I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

59
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,014
Sasha and Conny missed!

60
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,589
Lead 'em the hell back!

37
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:53,077
I... Oh, god.

54
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:56,510
I said I was sorry!

80
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:12,241
Mikasa! You saved my life!

38
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:13,918
Are you okay?

56
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:15,640
Because of you I am!

31
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:16,380
Then get up.

40
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:18,326
I owe you one.

28
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,447
No worries.

4
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:20,423
Wow.

81
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,110
By the skin of your teeth.

185
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,953
You're damn lucky you didn't end up worse off.

171
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:30,079
They're all dead! Start loading up supplies!

25
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:31,321
It worked!

145
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,271
We're gonna make it! We're gonna live!

71
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:40,995
No more of 'em coming in!

119
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:43,211
Thank you, crazy-berserker Titan!

134
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:48,001
I caved. In front of the whole gang.

196
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:50,844
I'm never gonna be able to face any of 'em again!

214
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:54,028
Damn it, feel sorry for yourself later! Focus on escape!

224
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:58,293
Listen, man. What you said
about me bein' a leader and all.

161
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:00,942
Don't talk to me like that again, alright?

212
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,227
Promise me you're not going to take this the wrong way.

227
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:10,636
But I don't think you're a
good leader 'cause you're strong.

241
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,652
I think you're a good leader
'cause you know what it is to be weak.

47
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:15,483
You're one of us.

207
00:17:15,871 --> 00:17:18,608
You're scared out of your mind just like we all are.

112
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:21,148
It makes you alert; sympathetic.

135
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:25,271
You made a damn good call out there.

92
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,328
Got me runnin' for my life.

82
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:28,925
You're why I can say this.

100
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,061
Ready, people? Let's do this!

12
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:45,981
Mikasa?

154
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:53,688
What're you doing? We have to leave now!

48
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:54,895
Look. Down there.

32
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,423
Cannibalism?

146
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:06,542
Can he not regenerate like the others?

234
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:11,015
This may sound stupid, but I
was hoping he'd be the key for us.

151
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:13,717
That he'd help mankind break the cycle.

235
00:18:13,907 --> 00:18:16,627
Turn the tide just long enough
to give us a little ray of hope.

33
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:17,936
She's right.

250
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:22,100
He's too valuable to just let die.
There's too much we can learn from him.

258
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:26,486
I think it's perfectly clear our priority
should be to ward the scavengers off him.

113
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,377
He's no good to us picked apart.

72
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:29,911
Are you out of your mind?

223
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,810
We've got a path out of this nightmare and you wanna stay?

260
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:37,743
Think about it. Having an Abnormal as an
ally would be an incredible advantage, right?

245
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:41,445
A cannon's got nothing on a Titan
who likes to rip apart his own kind.

215
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:45,318
You... Do you hear yourself? He's not like a new friend!

13
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:47,947
Oh, no.

101
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,303
It's the one that ate Thomas!

14
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:27,351
Holy...

104
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:34,493
What was that you were saying?

142
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:44,407
'Cause I think it's a moot point now.

65
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:47,104
Alright, enough of this!

73
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,574
Let's leave while we can!

186
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:51,202
We're lucky the ugly bastard didn't get bored.

114
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:53,244
We'd have been next on the menu.

83
00:19:57,648 --> 00:19:59,394
Look, a Titan's a Titan...

15
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:24,888
Mikasa!

23
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:35,924
It's him.

172
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:42,943
But... his arm. His leg. I don't understand.

167
00:21:43,408 --> 00:21:48,081
I watched him get eaten. I watched him die.

18
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,345
I saw...

58
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:02,117
How is this possible?

43
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,732
Okay. So, uh...

52
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:15,751
Eren did all this?

136
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,801
The overwhelming desire for revenge;

230
00:23:56,975 --> 00:24:00,579
an emotion powerful enough to
alter even our physical bodies.

239
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,443
When hate transforms you into
the very thing you despise, however;

228
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:07,944
you might just find the swords
of your allies turned on you.
