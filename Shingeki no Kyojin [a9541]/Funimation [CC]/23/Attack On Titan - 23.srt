1
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:40,320
That's good, Annie.

2
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,165
I expect the best from my daughter.

3
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:50,185
Move! Who told you it was time to rest?

4
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,487
Hold on. You mean you haven't heard?

5
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:11,661
The Titan kid and those big shot handlers
of his have been summoned to the capital.

6
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,212
Which means they'll be passing through here today.

7
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:18,582
Is that so? Well then maybe this time
they'll just dissect him and get it over with.

8
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:20,520
I just hope he doesn't stir up any trouble.

9
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:23,969
I say let him pass through and
seal the gate shut behind him!

10
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:28,678
Infidel! To even suggest sealing the gate!

11
00:02:29,186 --> 00:02:32,859
The hands of heretics must never
taint the sanctity of our Walls!

12
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:37,805
Maria! Rose! Sina!

13
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,689
To even think of defiling the three goddesses.

14
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,191
We tempt the specter of damnation!

15
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:45,678
These lunatics all worship the
Walls as if they're some kind of gods.

16
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:46,769
It creeps me out.

17
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:49,604
Damn cult. Can't believe they're still around.

18
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:50,722
Let's go.

19
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:04,024
Look who's finally awake!

20
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:08,115
You look so terrifying when you're
asleep I didn't dare disturb you.

21
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:10,118
Prob'ly should've. Sorry.

22
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,604
You've been pretty lax in your duties, recently.

23
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:15,858
Look, Marlo. You've upset her.

24
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:17,966
She's antisocial, not upset.

25
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:22,821
Knock it off, you guys. She fought in
the Battle of Trost before coming here.

26
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,096
Whichmakes her the only one of
us who's ever seen any real action.

27
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,106
She's just been through hell.

28
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:30,109
Probably takes time to readjust.

29
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:34,137
Ah! So. You have a crush on the new girl, huh?

30
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,416
What could you possibly see in her?

31
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:42,245
I dunno, Hitch. Maybe it's that she got into the
MP's based on skill, unlike some I could mention.

32
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,882
Oh. I don't know what you're implying.

33
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:46,512
Why don't you clarify?

34
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:47,752
That's enough, you two.

35
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:59,524
Great. Thanks, guys. I called you all here
'cause I've got actual work for you today.

36
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:01,494
Not just the same ol' crap.

37
00:04:01,978 --> 00:04:05,538
It's got somethin' to do with the
Scouts being summoned to the capital.

38
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:10,278
Sometime today, they'll be passing
through town along the main street.

39
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:16,779
HQ has already provided a security detail, so we're
only being asked to assist until the convoy's clear.

40
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,847
ODM use in city limits has been authorized.

41
00:04:19,934 --> 00:04:22,953
You'll follow beside the convoy, as additional security.

42
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:27,998
There's a barge waiting to take
you to the starting point. Dismissed.

43
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,217
Sir! A question, if I may.

44
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,846
Hmm? Go ahead.

45
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:36,516
What exactly are we supposed to
be protecting this convoy from, sir?

46
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:37,270
Hmm?

47
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:43,433
It's just that I've never heard of anyone
defying the government. They're just glad to be safe.

48
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,922
There are petty criminals, sure.

49
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:51,570
But I find it hard to imagine any actual organization
existing within the wall that would attempt a strike.

50
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:53,922
I mean, what possible motive would they have?

51
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:57,919
Man! Aren't you serious? You can be in charge of this.

52
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:00,653
Everything you need to know is right in here.

53
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:03,614
Uh... Huh?

54
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:06,706
We officers are busy enough as it is.

55
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:09,208
Prove that you can handle this one yourselves.

56
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:12,793
Oh, and you better not screw it up, got it?

57
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:16,336
Hey, sorry 'bout that. Back to business.

58
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:17,456
Who's turn was it?

59
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,551
Damn. This stinks!

60
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:29,460
Got that right. The amount of slacking that
goes on in this outfit is even more than I imagined.

61
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,591
I mean, that is why I chose to join, but still.

62
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,389
I might've thought twice if I'd known that meant
the rookies got stuck doing all the work all the time.

63
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,788
Seriously. Wish someone would've warned me.

64
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:44,548
Bastards. They're all irresponsible,
self absorbed imbeciles! All of them!

65
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:47,168
Hmm. So what's that make you, Marlo?

66
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:49,600
You chose to join the Military Police.

67
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:51,657
You're a slacker just like the rest of us.

68
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,811
You're wrong, Boris.

69
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,154
I'm nothing like the rest of you degenerates!

70
00:05:57,622 --> 00:06:01,102
I joined up because the Military
Police is in dire need of repair!

71
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:05,299
Wow. That was great, Marlo!

72
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,523
I never pegged you for the crusader type!

73
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,233
Just how do you plan to fix it?

74
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:12,003
By working my way to the top, of course.

75
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:13,727
And then once I'm in charge.

76
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:18,598
I can install a new system to make sure all
those who are dishonest pay for their transgressions.

77
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,266
It's as simple as that.

78
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:25,171
The MPs just need a little discipline, and nothing more.

79
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:28,086
I'll shape them back into the
people they're supposed to be.

80
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,363
Wow. That is something!

81
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:36,628
And I thought you were a total buzzkill before!

82
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:39,822
Well, that's a rather lofty ideal.

83
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,625
So, y'know, good luck with all that.

84
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,776
What's the point?

85
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,081
I think if a do-gooder like you was
actually put in charge of this regiment,

86
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,186
you'd quickly find yourself working alone.

87
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,714
Really? That's the first thing you open your mouth to say?

88
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,734
Don't get me wrong, I don't doubt your sincerity.

89
00:06:56,964 --> 00:06:59,023
I know conviction when I see it.

90
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:04,098
You're not the first person I've met who thought they
could take on the world and change things for the better.

91
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,934
It takes a lot of courage to go against the flow.

92
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:08,491
I respect that.

93
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:12,664
Of course, it could be that
you're all just a bunch of fools.

94
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:16,343
They might be, but don't go lumping me in with them!

95
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,043
Is that understood?

96
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:21,729
Bah! Enough chit-chat. Let's go!

97
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:32,868
The escort wagons are scheduled to pass
through the outer gate in forty five minutes.

98
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:37,118
Once we arrive, everyone take up your positions. Got it?

99
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:38,459
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,333
Hey! Watch it, bud!

101
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:49,504
What's goin' on? That's our gear.

102
00:07:49,757 --> 00:07:51,561
Shipping it to the Interior?

103
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:54,936
Isn't it a bit strange, having the
Merchant's Guild conduct the transport?

104
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:57,813
What're they up to?

105
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:08,823
Are those bastards illegally selling government property?

106
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:13,530
Hey, this isn't our assignment!

107
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:16,736
Look at him! Crusader-man's the genuine article!

108
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,224
Well, I suppose we have the time to spare.

109
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:21,274
I bet this'll be entertaining.

110
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:31,165
I'd say we've earned ourselves a drink!

111
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:32,737
Hmm?

112
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,266
What do you think you're lookin' at? Huh, rookie?

113
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,919
You... You can't sell government equipment.

114
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:41,509
It's against the law!

115
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:43,535
Is that so?

116
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:49,274
Those supplies are the property of the hard-working
citizens who pay for them with their taxes.

117
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:50,664
And that means...

118
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:56,304
Can you believe this business? A
rookie blackmailing his superior officers!

119
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:59,616
I'm thinkin' you got a bright future ahead of you, kid.

120
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:04,725
Go spend it on a girl, alright? She'll help you unwind.

121
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,555
Wait. Hey!

122
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,407
What you did was against the law!

123
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:35,880
Hey wait!

124
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:42,912
You're under arrest for a
treasonable offense against an officer.

125
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:45,514
Blatant disregard for the rule of law...

126
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:47,300
Is standard procedure!

127
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:49,010
So is this!

128
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:53,943
He's had enough. Don't you think, sir?

129
00:09:56,873 --> 00:09:58,732
So sorry about that fellas!

130
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:01,451
I hope our idiot hasn't caused you too much trouble.

131
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:04,167
We'll be sure to drive the lesson home, don't you worry!

132
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:09,045
Unless, of course... you'd rather have...

133
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:12,318
a much bigger problem on your hands.

134
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:16,363
Just this once.

135
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:17,382
Sir!

136
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:22,799
So, about that drink.

137
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:26,239
Yeah. I worked up quite the thirst!

138
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,458
Go ahead.

139
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:43,344
Aren't you going to "make the
dishonest pay for their transgressions"?

140
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:48,809
I'm not entirely opposed to helping you out with that.

141
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,550
Is it me, or do those serving
gals get prettier with every sip?

142
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:02,467
Damn it!

143
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:08,403
Hey, little lady! You workin' hard? Or hardly working?

144
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,683
You boys are all the same!

145
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:16,650
Those people you know.

146
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:19,342
The other "fools" you mentioned.

147
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:21,662
Would they have done it?

148
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:25,508
They might've.

149
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:33,658
I wanted to be brave. To go against the flow.

150
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:39,563
But when it comes down to it, I'm just another
piece of scum being swept away by the current.

151
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,581
Not sure what to say about that.

152
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,088
Maybe... that's just a part
of what it means to be ordinary.

153
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:50,131
Simply going with the flow.

154
00:11:50,774 --> 00:11:54,380
Is that so bad? To some people it makes you weak,

155
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:58,289
but an ordinary person is all I want to be.

156
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,211
Annie!

157
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,417
Hello.

158
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:39,040
So, you're a full-fledged MP now.

159
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:42,163
Armin.

160
00:12:55,668 --> 00:12:58,194
So, uh. What's with the outfit?

161
00:12:58,257 --> 00:12:59,895
Why I'm in the rain gear, you mean?

162
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,970
It's a makeshift disguise.

163
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:04,894
Needed to conceal my ODM rig. See?

164
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:08,213
What's this about?

165
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,750
Annie. We have a plan for Eren to escape,
and we're hoping that you'll help us.

166
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:20,646
Wait, escape to where? Stuck behind these walls,
where can you possibly hide that they won't find you?

167
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:23,008
We'll only need to hide him for a short while.

168
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,932
This isn't a mutiny. We have every intention of returning.

169
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:30,167
View this as a few loyal Scouts staging a
small act of protest. It's a stall tactic.

170
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:36,092
We need time to gather enough evidence
to overrun the council's ruling about Eren.

171
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,650
That's all we want.

172
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:39,930
You're serious about this?

173
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,035
How can you be so sure the evidence exists?

174
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:44,776
And what is it?

175
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:48,793
I can't say. I'm sorry.

176
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:54,849
Sorry, Armin. I'm gonna have to decline.

177
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:57,909
My lips are sealed, though. Best of luck.

178
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:01,706
Hold on! Annie, please!

179
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:03,994
They're going to kill Eren!

180
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,429
They'll kill him for no better reason than
that they fear what they don't understand.

181
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:13,369
They don't see that their fear is
pushing humanity to the brink of extinction!

182
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:16,364
Maybe it's too late to change their minds.

183
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:21,789
But what if we can? We have no choice
but to bet everything on that chance!

184
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,251
I'm sorry. The last thing we want is to cause you grief.

185
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:30,382
But, well. The only way to sneak
him through the Wall Sina checkpoints

186
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:33,496
 is with the help of someone in the Military Police!

187
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:35,783
It's our only hope.

188
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:42,466
But why me? Do I really look
like that good of a person to you?

189
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:45,596
A good person? I dunno.

190
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:50,005
Actually, I've never placed much
value in those sorts of labels.

191
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:55,897
The way I see it, "good" is merely a word applied
to people who are convenient to our needs in some way.

192
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:57,291
It's purely subjective.

193
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:02,161
Any way you try to look at it,
labeling people dehumanizes them.

194
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:06,356
Regardless, if you still choose
to say "no" to this request,

195
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:12,028
then at least in my eyes that makes you a bad person.

196
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:30,252
Alright.

197
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:37,879
Let's go.

198
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:52,457
We made it. Can't believe it was so easy.

199
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:53,101
Hush!

200
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,375
The Military Police, hard at work.

201
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,694
I'm almost surprised they bothered to show up at all.

202
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,156
Let's just keep moving.

203
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:02,453
Hopefully they haven't noticed my stand-in yet, either.

204
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:05,362
It's not gonna hold up under close scrutiny.

205
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,175
After all, Jean and I look nothing alike.

206
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:14,941
It's close enough. You both have that same angry
scowl, and the same boulder-sized chip on your shoulder.

207
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:16,913
Well, yeah! But I don't have his horse face!

208
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:22,619
Hey. So if I had refused to help you guys out,
then what was your Plan B for getting over the wall?

209
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:26,233
We would've used our ODM gear to
barge right through the checkpoint.

210
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:30,539
That's stupid. Why didn't you just
avoid all this trouble in the first place?

211
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:33,628
You could've escaped before reaching Stohess, right?

212
00:16:34,016 --> 00:16:35,927
I mean, why wait 'til now?

213
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:42,409
I felt that this town's complex layout would allow us
to squeeze a bit more time out of our body-double ploy.

214
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:45,898
Of course. A head-on assault is ill-advised.

215
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,900
So as long as the convoy acts like it's following orders.

216
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:51,306
Then everyone keeps their defenses down.

217
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:55,479
I see. It's a very good plan.

218
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:01,404
Ah! There it is!

219
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:11,440
Here?

220
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:13,831
Yeah. We'll pass through here.

221
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:18,621
It's what remains of an underground city
they were planning to build way back when.

222
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,904
And if I'm right, it should lead
us to the vicinity of the outer gate.

223
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:26,772
Nice work, Armin. That's amazing

224
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:29,481
Annie?

225
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:35,337
What's the matter? You're not afraid of
dark, cramped spaces or anything, are you?

226
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,642
So what? So what if I am?

227
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,742
I wouldn't expect a suicidal
maniac like you to understand.

228
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:46,882
You don't know what it is to be an
ordinary girl, crippled with fear.

229
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:54,508
A girl who can flip a full-grown man
upside down has nothing to fear from the dark.

230
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:56,607
Cut the crap and let's move!

231
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:59,767
No. I refuse.

232
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,416
I'm too afraid. Above ground, I'll help.

233
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:06,148
Otherwise the deal's off.

234
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:19,255
Quit being stubborn, dammit!
Just get the hell down here! Move!

235
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:19,984
We're running out of time, alright?

236
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,810
Stop shouting. Someone will hear you.

237
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:23,684
I'm sure it's fine, Mikasa.

238
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,306
It seems that, for whatever reason,

239
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:31,930
this place has been completely deserted.

240
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,695
That hurts me. It really does.

241
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:47,257
The way you're looking at me now.

242
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:50,585
If I didn't know better, I'd say you didn't trust me.

243
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:52,643
Eh, Armin?

244
00:18:53,936 --> 00:18:56,330
Annie. Tell me.

245
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:59,889
What were you doing with Marco's ODM gear?

246
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:07,683
It had all the same dents and scrapes.

247
00:19:07,873 --> 00:19:13,196
See, I helped him with
maintenance, so, I know you used it.

248
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,456
Yes. I found it. Found it and took it.

249
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,089
Then the two Titans we had in custody.

250
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:26,170
It was you that killed them.

251
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:27,720
No one knows.

252
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:33,392
But if you suspected all of this a month
ago, why did you wait this long to say anything?

253
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:35,458
Because even now it's difficult.

254
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:41,368
I just didn't want... I didn't want to
believe that I was right. So I stayed quiet.

255
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,437
But then, out in the field.

256
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,670
The fact that you didn't kill me then and there.

257
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:53,055
That's the moment that set us on
the path to our current situation.

258
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,163
Yes. We're here 'cause I let you live.

259
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:11,233
Of course, I never would've dreamed
you'd end up cornering in on me like this.

260
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,393
Why? Why didn't I do anything then?

261
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:23,303
Annie, please! You've taken this joke far enough.

262
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:25,583
Just tell us this is some kinda horrible prank.

263
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,735
It's not too late!

264
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,499
Come on! We'll understand!

265
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,509
Come down, lets talk.

266
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:35,141
You can prove to us that we're
mistaken by walking down these stairs!

267
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:36,976
Prove we're wrong to accuse you!

268
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:42,522
We both know I can't. Like I told you,
I don't have the constitution for it.

269
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,625
Annie, stop!

270
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,848
We're talking about a matter of life and death!

271
00:20:45,873 --> 00:20:46,866
Work with us, Annie!

272
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:49,096
We can reason this out like human beings.

273
00:20:49,157 --> 00:20:50,117
Enough.

274
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:53,207
I'm not listening to another word of this.

275
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,390
No point.

276
00:20:57,718 --> 00:20:59,885
I'm going to carve you up again!

277
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,328
Do you understand me, Titan?

278
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,630
You know, Armin. It's nice that I
could be a "good person" for you.

279
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:37,713
For now, at least, it looks like you won your bet.

280
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,399
But...

281
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:44,890
I'm going to gamble, too. And here's my wager!

282
00:21:57,932 --> 00:21:58,712
Eren!

283
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:05,870
What're you...?

284
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,134
It's too late.

285
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,230
The identity of the Female Titan has been discovered.

286
00:23:57,452 --> 00:23:59,761
All along, it was Annie Leonhart.

287
00:23:59,928 --> 00:24:02,888
However, even when faced with irrefutable truth,

288
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:05,476
Eren can neither bring himself to transform,

289
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:08,047
nor fight his former comrade in arms.
