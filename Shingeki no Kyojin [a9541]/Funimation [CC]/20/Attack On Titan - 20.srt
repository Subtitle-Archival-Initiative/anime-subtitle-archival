1
00:00:02,484 --> 00:00:05,390
After setting forth to establish a route to Shiganshina,

2
00:00:05,508 --> 00:00:07,908
the Scout Regiment encountered a Female Titan

3
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:09,479
seemingly possessed of sharp,

4
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:11,289
cold-hearted intelligence.

5
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:23,942
As soldier upon soldier fell to this new foe, the
regiment retreated into a forest of massive trees.

6
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,764
Though to what purpose, no one appeared to know.

7
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:29,704
If the Levi Squad can't stop this thing, then who can?

8
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,007
Those men need us!

9
00:00:32,843 --> 00:00:33,988
Another one!

10
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:37,351
Damn it, he didn't have to die!

11
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:41,464
The choice is yours. You can trust yourself,

12
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:45,371
or you can trust the people willing
to put their lives on the line for you.

13
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:49,524
I'm with you!

14
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,713
Fire!

15
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:07,159
Wait, what?

16
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:10,671
They're going to take her alive? Seriously?

17
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:12,920
So what do you think of us now, Eren?

18
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:15,026
We managed to outsmart the damn thing!

19
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:17,108
Let this be a lesson to you, greenhorn.

20
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:19,420
Don't ever underestimate the Scouts!

21
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:21,875
Never again! Agreed?

22
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:23,224
Agreed!

23
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:28,605
She's not putting up much of a fight.

24
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,750
That's no reason to let our guard down.

25
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:33,093
Good work, leading her here.

26
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:35,087
I'm more than a little impressed.

27
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:38,935
We couldn't have without the rear
contingent whose lives bought us time.

28
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,538
This belongs to them.

29
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,406
I don't intend to ever forget that.

30
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:44,677
That so?

31
00:01:45,383 --> 00:01:46,210
Yes.

32
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:49,532
Because of their sacrifices,

33
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:52,415
we can expose whoever this really is.

34
00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:56,708
Ten to one they're in there
pissing themselves right about now.

35
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:48,157
An Abnormal? No, she's more
like... more like the Colossal Titan!

36
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:52,128
Wait, so does that mean Commander Erwin was...?

37
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:54,250
Hey! Snap out of it, runt!

38
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:56,396
You can puzzle it all out later.

39
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:58,803
Right now we need you focused on pushing ahead.

40
00:03:58,835 --> 00:03:59,527
Right!

41
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:09,634
Not quite yet, Levi. A little more insurance.

42
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,351
Second and third waves!

43
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,321
Fire!

44
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:15,291
All reserves!

45
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,924
They, uh... They've figured out how to climb.

46
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,905
I can see that. Well, if they make it up this
far we can always go up a little further, I suppose.

47
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,806
Anyway. I doubt we'll be here much longer.

48
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:46,682
I suspect the order to withdraw will be coming any minute.

49
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,382
What makes you say that? Those explosions just now?

50
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,695
I hope everything's alright in there.

51
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:52,639
Me, too.

52
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:59,155
Mikasa. You think that's cannon fire or what?

53
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:01,824
I mean, nothing else makes that kind of racket, right?

54
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:08,943
If that's the case, why didn't
we see them bring any cannons in?

55
00:05:09,077 --> 00:05:11,333
What the hell's with all the noise? Seriously.

56
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:13,550
Gimme a hand here, Bertholdt.

57
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,655
You happen see what tree Christa scuttled up?

58
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:17,734
Sorry. I don't have a clue.

59
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:19,817
Nothing makes sense anymore.

60
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,962
What are we even doing here?

61
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:24,084
I just wanna go home.

62
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:28,844
Whaddya say we get outta the way?

63
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,863
Ugly bastard is really gettin' the hang of it.

64
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:42,107
At this rate, he's gonna try his
hand at buildin' a damn tree house.

65
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:44,394
The alarming thing is that this shows that they can learn.

66
00:05:44,488 --> 00:05:48,546
Not a pleasant thought. Of course, they
probably all develop at different rates.

67
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:52,495
Hey, Armin. They want us keeping
these Titans outta the forest right?

68
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:54,767
I think I just figured out why.

69
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:58,217
We're here to lure that Female Titan into a trap.

70
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:00,060
C'mon. What else could it be?

71
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:02,873
It's like you said.

72
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,851
There's a person inside it steerin' the thing.

73
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:08,719
Commander Erwin wants to find out who.

74
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,461
So that was the plan from the start?

75
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:14,870
We weren't flying by the seat of our pants?

76
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,492
Look, I'm not complaining. I get keeping it from me.

77
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,557
But, come on! Keeping you guys in the dark?

78
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:21,932
You'd think you'd earned a
little more trust than that, right?

79
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:23,021
Damn, you're annoying.

80
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:27,342
I hope you're not suggesting the captain kept the
plan from us because he thinks we're a liability!

81
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,788
I'm sorry, but I am!

82
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,846
There's just no other way it makes sense!

83
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:32,522
Enough of this!

84
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:34,833
Petra! Knock the teeth out of his skull!

85
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:37,137
Look, I hate to say it, but he's got a point.

86
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:37,648
Huh?

87
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:42,850
For being as supposedly instrumental to the plan
as we were, the captain didn't give us much to go on.

88
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:43,954
So, what?

89
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,117
That means he doesn't trust us. Kind of a big deal.

90
00:06:47,427 --> 00:06:49,111
C'mon, you guys. Think about it.

91
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,375
Maybe Eren isn't the only one who can change.

92
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:54,188
Maybe someone in the regiment's a Titan spy.

93
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,717
It's the only way all the pieces fit. You with me?

94
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,252
Yeah. Best explanation.

95
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:10,601
A spy? Are you sure about that?

96
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,066
Well, no. But I'm sure the commander believes it.

97
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:17,175
He'd have to. And I'll wager you anything the only people

98
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,150
in the know on this were the
survivors from five years ago.

99
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,488
Of course. That's got to be it.

100
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,642
I concur whole-heartedly. Hear that, Snivel-drop?

101
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,097
There was a good reason.

102
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,949
Right. Yes. A perfectly good reason.

103
00:07:30,966 --> 00:07:31,934
It adds up.

104
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:34,210
After all, in their position, it's the best way of

105
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:37,146
narrowing down the list of
suspects to a manageable number.

106
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:39,640
Shiganshina's probably when the spy got in.

107
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:44,368
So, you think this person's
responsible for killing Sawney and Beane?

108
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:49,279
Possibly. In fact, after it happened,
the commander asked me this odd question.

109
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:53,416
What is it you think you see?

110
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:56,244
Who do you think the real enemy is here?

111
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:59,080
So that's what he meant. Of course.

112
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:04,149
If we'd known the answer to that question, he
probably would've let us in on what was happening today.

113
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:07,398
Though, there again, I really
don't think any of us could've.

114
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:10,052
Speak for yourself, my friend. I knew.

115
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:12,333
I just decided to keep my own counsel.

116
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:15,256
Doubtless you appreciate the reason for my silence.

117
00:08:15,526 --> 00:08:16,472
Which would be?

118
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:22,605
Oh, come now. Surely you all know? Dear
oh dear. Perhaps I've said too much already.

119
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:26,062
Well, one day, when you've
reached my level of expertise...

120
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,532
Look, we all get that you like
to pretend you're Captain Levi.

121
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,272
But that's not how he sounds.

122
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,579
If we pull this off, we might
learn what the Titans are all about.

123
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:39,504
But, even for that...

124
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:43,492
was it worth letting so many people die?

125
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:49,561
You think the commander was
wrong to leave us out of the loop?

126
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:55,268
Well he certainly wasn't in the right.

127
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:59,248
Why put so many of our lives at risk
just because one of us can't be trusted?

128
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:01,710
Hell, we could've smoked out the spy.

129
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,896
Maybe saved some good people.

130
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,561
No. He did what was necessary.

131
00:09:11,782 --> 00:09:13,611
Are you seriously trying to defend him?

132
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:16,693
Do you know how many of us died so
the commander could play intrigue?

133
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:18,711
Of course I do. All I'm saying

134
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:22,953
is it's easy to judge in hindsight. At the time, though,

135
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,838
there was no way to know how things would turn out.

136
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:30,088
He's a commander, not a soothsayer.
He had to act on what he had. Period.

137
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,785
He had to choose: a handful of us, or all of us?

138
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,192
What would you have done?

139
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:42,657
He made a decision. He sacrificed a
hundred lives for the good of mankind.

140
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:49,600
Eren, I can understand why you still have your doubts,
but in time you'll come to realize, just like we all did,

141
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:54,067
why Erwin Smith was entrusted to lead
the Scouts and carry humanity's hope.

142
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,712
Or why even someone as cagey
as Captain Levi can trust him.

143
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:01,343
Indeed. Live long enough and
you'll understand the weight of it.

144
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:04,465
I may be naive but,

145
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,937
there's one thing I know beyond all doubt.

146
00:10:07,151 --> 00:10:12,339
Genuine harbingers of change must be able to
do what others won't dare. Sacrifice their heart.

147
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,786
Accept the burden of doing the unspeakable.

148
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,806
Whether we like to admit it or not, the fact is this:

149
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:22,707
To rise above monsters, we have to abandon our humanity.

150
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,701
That's the irony, really.

151
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:28,371
If you can't let it go, it's not worth holding on to.

152
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,212
Fire!

153
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:48,035
Poor thing.

154
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,553
Can't so much as bat an eyelash, can we?

155
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,835
Must be terribly frustrating.

156
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:54,765
Get used to it, my dear.

157
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,745
Heh. Biology can often times be a curse.

158
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:01,152
Case in point, the more your wounds
heal, the stiffer your joints become.

159
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:07,271
Now what in the world is the hold-up
on the extraction of our esteemed guest?

160
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:08,683
It won't get any easier.

161
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:11,130
Strike while the iron is hot, I say!

162
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:40,420
An impressive ability. So she can harden
her skin to protect portions of her body.

163
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,138
Similar to the one who rushed Wall Maria.

164
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:45,603
The Armored Titan, I believe they called him.

165
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,140
The question is, how many blade strikes
would it take to finally chip our way through?

166
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:54,024
Too many, in any event. Time is short.

167
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,917
Yes, sir?

168
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,800
Prepare an artillery round. I want her hands blown off.

169
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:05,193
With all due respect, Commander,
there's a risk if we use the cannons.

170
00:12:05,336 --> 00:12:08,689
The hands will get blown off, but
whatever's beneath them will too, sir.

171
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,339
A fine point, soldier.

172
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,330
Which is why you'll aim carefully
and sever them at the wrists.

173
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:15,698
On my signal I want an all-out salvo.

174
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,731
Yes, sir!

175
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:29,125
Knock knock. We know you're in there.

176
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:33,271
Why don't you make this easy and
come on out. Stop wasting our time.

177
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,307
Seriously, what can you hope to gain by stalling?

178
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:40,056
If you're thinking we'll let you go, we won't.

179
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:42,194
If you're thinking about trying to escape, don't.

180
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:46,873
All you should be thinking about
are the good men you killed today.

181
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:49,488
Not that you would.

182
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:52,148
That's not your style, is it? Remorse.

183
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:54,038
You enjoy killing.

184
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:58,281
Which means we have something in common.

185
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:01,269
'Course, I enjoy killing Titans.

186
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:05,725
But it's a start. I'm sure we
can still find some middle ground.

187
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,262
Oh, that's right.

188
00:13:09,349 --> 00:13:11,708
While we're on that subject, let me ask.

189
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:16,340
You're okay with me cuttin' your
limbs off at the joints, right?

190
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:18,327
I mean, they'll grow back.

191
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:21,338
I'm talking about your actual body.

192
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:24,405
Don't want you dead just yet.

193
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:26,716
Timing wouldn't work.

194
00:13:57,732 --> 00:14:00,998
Nicely done. I almost lost my composure.

195
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,582
Were those like, death throes or something?

196
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,729
They're coming. I can smell them.

197
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,683
From what direction?

198
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:13,169
From every direction. Fast. Dozens.

199
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:21,543
What the hell is this? They... They're all going in!

200
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,172
Why're they ignoring us all've a sudden?

201
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:29,106
Oh no.

202
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:32,356
You... You tellin' me they're all Abnormals?

203
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:34,955
Who cares? Concentrate on pushing 'em back!

204
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:37,598
Engage!

205
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,231
What's going on over there?

206
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:42,881
Wait! Please!

207
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:46,695
I know that sound. It used to haunt my sleep.

208
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:48,890
I'd hear it from the forest in the dead of night.

209
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:52,544
Believe me, nothing in the world
screams like that except a dying animal.

210
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:56,175
It's the sound of a creature who knows
it's got absolutely nothing to lose.

211
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:59,075
It's alright, I know to be careful.

212
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:01,267
That is not the right attitude to have!

213
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:03,763
You can't just be careful, you have to be terrified!

214
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:06,164
Have you ever seen me terrified of anything?

215
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:09,238
No! And I'm tellin' ya this'd
be a good time to try it out!

216
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:09,992
Right.

217
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:12,782
I have to give her credit.

218
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:15,244
The girl's instincts are usually dead-on.

219
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:18,373
Especially right before all hell breaks lose.

220
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:21,140
Eren's in the center rank, I think.

221
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,973
That's what Armin said.

222
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:30,602
Faster on the artillery, gentlemen!

223
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:34,757
Here they are. First wave's closing
from the east, and coming in fast!

224
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:39,046
Wagon defense squad! Intercept, now!

225
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:48,350
What's going on? Damn things passed right by us!

226
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:50,717
Three Titans have broken through!

227
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,774
Captain Levi!

228
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:54,603
Hey! What did you do?

229
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,573
You called up some friends, didn't you?

230
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:10,049
It ignored us and went straight for her?

231
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:14,751
The enemy is bearing down from all directions!

232
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:17,142
All hands, commence combat!

233
00:16:17,864 --> 00:16:20,456
Defend the Female Titan at all costs!

234
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:37,900
No!

235
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,091
All hands, withdraw!

236
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:56,506
Redeploy the formation!

237
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:59,551
Return to Calaneth District!

238
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:19,351
We've been bested.

239
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,527
Oh, don't give me that crap.

240
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:24,721
Not now. Not yet.

241
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:29,566
Think about it. The enemy was prepared
to make sacrifices. Enormous ones.

242
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:36,255
So committed to maintaining her secret, she would
rather let herself be cannibalized than exposed.

243
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,546
That whole song and dance in the courtroom,
and this is what we've got to show for it.

244
00:17:42,157 --> 00:17:46,503
We scurry back now with our tail between our
legs, Eren's right back in chains, or worse.

245
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,864
We'll jump off that bridge when we come to it.

246
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:53,354
Right now our only concern is getting
back without sustaining further casualties.

247
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,251
However we can.

248
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:59,208
This steam isn't helping matters.

249
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:02,164
Smoke signals aren't likely to cut through the murk.

250
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:09,704
I'll gather up my squad.

251
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:11,689
Not yet, Levi.

252
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:14,282
First replenish your blades and your fuel.

253
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,950
I can deal with what I've got.

254
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,865
We're running against the clock as it is. Why?

255
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,677
Because I said. That's an order.

256
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:24,880
Whatever you say, sir.

257
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,664
I trust you implicitly.

258
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:44,289
Withdraw? I guess we're done here.

259
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:46,585
We return to HQ on horseback.

260
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:47,522
Understood.

261
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:50,595
Hold on. You tellin' me it's over?

262
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:55,696
Ah! Thank god!

263
00:18:56,898 --> 00:18:59,693
I don't like this. Eren...

264
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:03,299
That's our cue.

265
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,397
Alright, let's saddle up! We're going home!

266
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,754
Chop-chop, runt. One would think you'd be beside yourself
to get an eyeful of who's driving that gargantuan harpy.

267
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:17,094
You really think they found out who it is?

268
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,772
Of course, all thanks to you!

269
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:20,581
I didn't do anything.

270
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:23,441
You learned to trust the fellow members of your squad.

271
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,548
That's big. The sort of thing that turns
out well for everyone involved, actually.

272
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:30,234
A lesser man in your dilemma probably would've buckled.

273
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:31,623
Then where would we be?

274
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:33,647
Oh, please.

275
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:35,898
Why don't you stroke his forehead while you're at it.

276
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:41,396
We'd be exactly where we are now, without of
course having had to endure his incessant whining.

277
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:44,925
Don't wait for me to decorate your
path in pink and white rose petals.

278
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:48,078
Survive the journey home and I
might be persuaded to respect you.

279
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,200
The mission isn't over.

280
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:51,901
Not 'til we're though the gates.

281
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:53,163
Do you understand?

282
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:55,736
Yes, sir. I completely understand.

283
00:19:58,403 --> 00:19:59,697
Oruo! Petra!

284
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:04,508
I gotta hand it to ya both. For someone who wet
themselves first time out, you've come a long way.

285
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:09,457
I thought we agreed never to speak of it again!

286
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:11,388
Whoa. Seriously?

287
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,988
Relax. Incidentally, I've never
once pissed myself in battle.

288
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:19,834
How dare you! I have the highest kill-count
of anyone on the damn squad! Argh! Imbecile!

289
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:23,592
You wanna hide that stain behind
your kill-counts, be my guest.

290
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:24,697
Shut your hole!

291
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,914
So did it, like, rain down on everyone midair, or what?

292
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,759
Enough! No one cares who pissed who's pants!

293
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:32,490
Focus on the job at hand!

294
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:35,382
For the record, my shorts've always been dry.

295
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,860
Huh?

296
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:48,562
Must be a signal from the captain himself.

297
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:52,653
Stow the chatter 'til we're home.
We'll rendezvous with Levi shortly.

298
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:16,856
Erwin. Why bother having him replenish?

299
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:18,245
There's no time.

300
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:20,437
We saw the Female Titan get eaten.

301
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:23,965
Did we actually see the person
inside suffer the same fate?

302
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:25,243
I didn't.

303
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,414
You mean...?

304
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:30,838
Yes. Your hypothesis is correct. This isn't over.

305
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:32,832
We're dealing with someone like Eren.

306
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:35,890
Someone who regenerates in and out of Titan form.

307
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:40,060
Suppose that person equipped
themselves with ODM gear in advance.

308
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:45,470
Suppose further that they're also
disguised in one of our uniforms?

309
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:47,282
What would their next move be?

310
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:48,729
Captain Levi?

311
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:52,605
Wait, that... That's not... Oh shit!

312
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:04,251
Gunther! You okay? What happened?

313
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:05,831
Talk to me!

314
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,289
How do you ferret out the enemy...

315
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:19,466
when they're one of your own?

316
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:56,452
Erwin's plan has backfired.

317
00:23:56,777 --> 00:24:00,023
The dreaded Female Titan comes for Eren yet again.

318
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:04,746
But between her and her quarry
stands a team of expert Titan slayers.

319
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:07,674
The Special Operations Squad.
