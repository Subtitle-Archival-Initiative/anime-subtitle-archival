1
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:05,960
It's officially begun. The 57th Recon Mission!

2
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:08,747
Scouts, move out!

3
00:00:13,537 --> 00:00:16,501
After setting forth to establish a route to Shiganshina,

4
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:22,739
the Scout Regiment encountered a Female Titan
seemingly possessed of sharp, cold-hearted intelligence.

5
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:30,315
We're not dealing with an Abnormal,

6
00:00:30,393 --> 00:00:32,166
this thing's showing intelligence!

7
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,700
It's a human being wrapped in a Titan body!

8
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:47,263
As soldier upon soldier fell to this new foe, the
regiment retreated into a forest of massive trees.

9
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:49,851
Though to what purpose, no one appeared to know.

10
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:53,498
If the Levi Squad can't stop this thing, then who can?

11
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:54,633
Those men need us!

12
00:00:55,562 --> 00:00:56,937
The choice is yours.

13
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:58,709
You can trust yourself,

14
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:02,826
or you can trust the people willing
to put their lives on the line for you.

15
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:06,670
I'm with you!

16
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:14,599
Fire!

17
00:01:19,874 --> 00:01:20,868
Oh, that's right.

18
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:23,537
While we're on that subject, let me ask.

19
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:28,018
You're okay with me cuttin' your
limbs off at the joints, right?

20
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:30,123
I'm mean, they'll grow back?

21
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,269
I'm talking about your actual body.

22
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:36,224
Don't want you dead just yet.

23
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,605
Timing wouldn't work.

24
00:01:48,698 --> 00:01:53,457
Think about it. The enemy was prepared
to make sacrifices. Enormous ones.

25
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:59,533
So committed to maintaining her secret, she would
rather let herself be cannibalized than exposed.

26
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:03,140
All hands, withdraw!

27
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:06,462
Redeploy the formation!

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,869
Return to Calaneth District!

29
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,728
Erwin. Why bother having him replenish?

30
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,016
There's no time.

31
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:21,188
We saw the Female Titan get eaten.

32
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:25,844
Did we actually see the person
inside suffer the same fate? I didn't.

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,441
You mean?

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,929
Yes. Your hypothesis is correct. This isn't over.

35
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:32,939
We're dealing with someone like Eren.

36
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:36,060
Someone who regenerates in and out of Titan form.

37
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,207
Suppose that person equipped
themselves with ODM gear in advance.

38
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,004
Suppose further that they're also
disguised in one of our uniforms?

39
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:46,625
What would their next move be?

40
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:48,078
Captain Levi?

41
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:51,752
Wait, that... That's not... Oh shit!

42
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,504
Gunther!

43
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:08,334
How do you ferret out the enemy...

44
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:10,407
when they're one of your own?

45
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,526
When the Colossal Titan breached the
wall and disappeared, theoretically,

46
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:57,433
whoever was inside had with ODM gear.

47
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,633
They would have used it in
escape before the steam cleared.

48
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:03,810
It's possible the same thing happened here.

49
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:05,105
I don't see how, sir.

50
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:08,208
Based on Eren's condition when he emerged from Titan form,

51
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,517
I think it's safe to assume that
something like that is highly unlikely.

52
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:14,130
His equipment was broken.

53
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:16,113
Parts of his uniform were missing.

54
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,906
More importantly, Eren was so spent he couldn't
even stand on his own two feet without assistance.

55
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:28,573
The Female Titan's ability to summon reinforcements
was unlike anything we've encountered before.

56
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:32,528
Our failure to anticipate that
factor cost us the operation.

57
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:36,993
Evidently, there are different
levels of mastery to the Titan ability.

58
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:40,972
We were naive to think that a mere
novice like Eren would set the standard.

59
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:46,750
If we're to stop this enemy, it's clear now
that we'll need to broaden our way of thinking.

60
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:53,194
So if we're goin' home, that means
the operation's a success, right?

61
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:54,800
Hopefully so.

62
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:59,631
If that is the case, then that might mean they've
already discovered the Female Titan's identity.

63
00:06:00,157 --> 00:06:02,150
I wouldn't mind knowin' that myself.

64
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:04,644
Still, I'm impressed with the commander.

65
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,380
How'd he know she'd come after us
once we took Eren beyond the Wall?

66
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:11,187
Think about it. During the Trost invasion,

67
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:15,627
did it strike you as odd the way the Titans
suddenly halted their advance midway through?

68
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:16,238
Huh?

69
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:19,573
They must have intended some purpose
when they destroyed the front gate,

70
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:22,179
but they never made a move on the inner gate.

71
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,547
Nor did they interfere with
Eren when he sealed the breach.

72
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:30,831
Perhaps, something happened which made
them re-evaluate their plan entirely.

73
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,479
And what would that be?

74
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:36,728
Something drew their focus
away from the Wall's destruction.

75
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:39,460
Something that forced them to call off the attack.

76
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,359
You mean Eren's transformation?

77
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,569
That's the most logical conclusion.

78
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:47,459
Wait, but then that would mean...

79
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,408
It means they were there.

80
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:54,109
Whoever called off the attack saw Eren transform.

81
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:57,812
It means the enemy is one of us!

82
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:00,924
Gunther!

83
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,237
Go kid! C'mon!

84
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,324
Keep moving!

85
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,257
We... We're just leaving him?

86
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:10,438
Who is that?

87
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:12,001
Keep 'em away from Eren!

88
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:15,595
Damn it! Hey, Eld. What're we doin', huh?

89
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,087
There isn't time to get the horses.

90
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:19,399
Make for HQ at full speed!

91
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:29,449
Is that the Female Titan? Or did she have an accomplice?

92
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:35,009
Damn! Whoever it is, they're gonna
pay! Even if it's the last thing I do!

93
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:39,095
The Female Titan? No. That can't be right!

94
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:40,778
I thought we caught her!

95
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:53,459
We have to consider that if the enemy
was still able-bodied when they escaped,

96
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:58,321
then it's entirely possible they
can make the Titan reappear as well.

97
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:03,614
I hate being right!

98
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:05,308
No time to lose! Move it!

99
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:07,109
She's coming for us!

100
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:16,391
Damn you!

101
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,772
Not again! I'll kill you! I swear I will!

102
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:20,959
No! Don't!

103
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:24,287
We've got this! The three of us can handle her!

104
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:27,831
You get back to base! Go! Now!

105
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:32,732
This enemy forces us to rethink everything we've learned.

106
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:38,389
What seems the most logical strategy
might prove to be the worst course of action.

107
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,489
Mark my words. The time will come

108
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:44,810
when risking everything is the only choice left to us.

109
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:46,351
I can fight her, too!

110
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:51,420
Just go! This is our best course of
action! We can not afford to put you at risk!

111
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,239
Have you learned nothing? After
all this, you still doubt our skills?

112
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,780
Is that true, Eren?

113
00:08:57,114 --> 00:09:00,540
I thought you had faith in us. That you trusted us!

114
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:07,675
And unless we can take that risk, humanity can never win.

115
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:16,675
I have faith in the Levi Squad!

116
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:18,627
Good luck!

117
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:50,633
We've blinded her! That should give us at
least a minute before she can regenerate!

118
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:52,435
We'll finish her well before then!

119
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,778
To hell with capturing you!

120
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:54,662
We're gonna kill you!

121
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,827
We're gonna carve you up!

122
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:58,062
We'll make you pay, bitch!

123
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:04,169
Covering your neck isn't gonna save you!

124
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,291
We'll just keep slicing those
shoulders 'til your arms are worthless.

125
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,516
Trust me, we know what we're doing. No mercy!

126
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,411
We'll cut you to ribbons!

127
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:30,485
Lop off your arms!

128
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,160
Send you to hell!

129
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:36,316
They're down!

130
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:39,811
Now go for the neck!

131
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:42,296
Take out the muscles supporting her head!

132
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:44,051
Let's chop our way to the nape!

133
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:52,479
They... They've got her totally overwhelmed!

134
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:57,201
They're so good. They pulled off a
coordinated attack without even saying a word!

135
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,467
It must be the trust they have in each other as teammates.

136
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,130
That's how they've survived this long.

137
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:08,713
It's how they're able to stay
strong even after losing Gunther.

138
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:12,757
Gotta keep going!

139
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:17,261
I have to have faith that the right
choice is to keep moving without looking back!

140
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:21,472
I've got to trust in them. I understand that, now!

141
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:25,316
Truth is, I don't know which is better.

142
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,132
I never have. Should I go out on my own?

143
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:33,358
Or should I put myself in the hands of my comrades?

144
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:36,274
Either way, there's no guarantee.

145
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,760
Say goodbye to your nape...!

146
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:49,740
Eld!

147
00:11:57,648 --> 00:12:00,886
How? She can see again? That's impossible!

148
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,842
It hasn't even been thirty seconds.

149
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:09,985
Only one eye? She channeled her energy into one
eye to grow it back quicker? How can she do that?

150
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,697
Petra! Pull yourself together!

151
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:16,729
Petra!

152
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,796
Now...

153
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:31,292
die!

154
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,618
What the hell? My blades weren't able to...

155
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:58,987
I'm gonna...

156
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:04,070
I'm gonna...

157
00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:07,806
kill you!

158
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:23,982
That's Eren!

159
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:27,122
Hang on a second! Mikasa!

160
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,927
That roaring. This isn't good.

161
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,704
I made the wrong decision when you came after us.

162
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:53,395
I made the choice to trust my teammates.

163
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,113
And it got them all killed!

164
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:07,029
I should never have left it to them.

165
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,882
I should have fought her from the very start!

166
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,759
I-It's all my fault.

167
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:14,489
I should have killed her!

168
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:33,142
I should've...

169
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:36,718
I should've changed into a Titan then.

170
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:41,382
No. Even earlier than that.

171
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:44,028
I should've fought back!

172
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:49,509
And with Captain Levi there.

173
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:51,528
We would've beaten her.

174
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:54,389
We could've captured this monster!

175
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:56,541
I wouldn't blame you.

176
00:16:57,287 --> 00:16:59,617
Do as your conscience dictates.

177
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:05,559
It was... It was my choice.

178
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:08,072
And because of that choice,

179
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:10,912
my squad-mates are dead.

180
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:16,759
All of them, gone. And I'm to blame.

181
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:23,266
No. More than anything, this is your fault!

182
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:37,750
I'm going to rip you to shreds.

183
00:17:38,086 --> 00:17:40,452
Once my hands heal.

184
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:45,473
I'll tear you apart. Piece by piece.

185
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,922
Then I'll devour you!

186
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,452
A...

187
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,705
Eren, no!

188
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,329
N-No. Wait, I...

189
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,292
Eren.

190
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,150
Please, you can't leave me.

191
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,849
Give him back.

192
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:41,614
Do you hear me? Give him back!

193
00:20:58,017 --> 00:20:59,829
Give him back!

194
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:17,063
My blades didn't even break the skin.

195
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,728
He's still alive. He's still alive.

196
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,478
And I'm coming for him.

197
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,430
Just hang on, Eren!

198
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,829
I know you're in there.

199
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:33,215
And after I kill her, I'll carve out her insides,

200
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,719
and pull you out again. I swear I will.

201
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:39,150
Just hang on a little longer.

202
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:41,255
Don't give up, Eren.

203
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:43,432
Never give up!

204
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:51,783
Get back here!

205
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:53,853
What?

206
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:57,437
We'll stay back for now.

207
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:05,271
Maintain current distance.

208
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,307
She's slowed down a bit.

209
00:22:07,656 --> 00:22:09,213
That fight wore her out, too.

210
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:14,054
It looked like she may have bitten the entire nape off.

211
00:22:14,217 --> 00:22:16,187
It's unlikely Eren survived.

212
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:57,253
"He's still alive. Give him back."

213
00:23:57,713 --> 00:24:00,642
After watching helplessly as Eren was taken away,

214
00:24:00,793 --> 00:24:04,634
Mikasa fights alongside Levi, humanity's greatest soldier,

215
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:07,785
in a battle against the Female Titan.
